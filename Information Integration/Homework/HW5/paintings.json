      "curator notes" : "A member of the American postwar abstract expressionist movement, Alice Baber achieved international recognition during the 1960s and 1970s. She is best identified with abstract staining, a technique most often identified with Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis, but also characteristic of Paul Jenkins, who Baber was briefly married to during the late 1960s.She lived in France during part of the 1950s and 1960s and it was there that she painted Journeying Blue. Her work of this period shared with her husband's an overall composition of colorful abstract forms noted for their glowing transparency. However, Baber worked with more controlled geometric shapes, usually ovoids, and applied the pigment by rubbing it into the canvas with her fingers rather than pouring the liquid in large gestural sweeps as did Jenkins. The energy of her paintings derived mainly from the congested yet orchestrated movement, often elliptical, of the shapes, which she referred to as \"wind\"; often the ovoids were directed towards a brilliant unstained white area near the center of the composition. Sometimes, as in Journeying Blue, her paintings tended toward the monochromatic.Baber is not as well known as the other exponents of stain painting because she died at a relatively young age of fifty-four and devoted considerable time to teaching throughout the United States (including at the University of California campuses at Santa Barbara and Berkeley), organizing exhibitions of women artists, and writing about art. Her work is in collections in the United States and abroad, including the Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum.",

The Confidantes shows the artist\u2019s feeling for the large design and opulent forms. Critics have always marveled at his technique and sensuous paint surfaces, which seem almost Venetian. However, Gluckmann\u2019s mature images of women are modern in spirit. The confidantes are unmistakably workingclass women, as shown by their clothes and slick, red-polished fingernails and lipstick. Consequently, despite his old master painting style, Gluckmann, in subject matter, paralleled East Coast realist artists.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Through the generosity of Deborah and John Landis, the museum acquired its second Mary Cassatt painting, Woman and Child (Mathilde Holding a Child). Cassatt was one of the foremost American artists of the 19th century. Almost her entire career was spent in France as an expatriate, and it was there she became a confidant of Degas and a member of the radical circle of French impressionists. The only American invited to exhibit with them in Paris, Cassatt first presented her famous \u201cmother and child\u201d images at their annual shows. Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy Child (1880), the museum\u2019s other Cassatt oil, is believed to be the artist\u2019s earliest dated modern Madonna. Woman and Child is slightly smaller but equally rich in palette. Manifold are the discussions about Cassatt\u2019s maternal themes and their relationship both to her own life (she remained single, but lived in close rapport with her extended family) and to a contemporary religious revival in France. Recently, scholars have begun questioning the identity of these so-called mothers, and clues can sometimes be found in their attire. Is the woman in our 1880 painting the mother or a servant? She appears to be wearing intimate at-home attire, but an upper-middle-class woman probably would have relegated the domestic chore of her children\u2019s toilet to a nursemaid. One of Cassatt\u2019s servants, Mathilde Vallet, often posed for the artist; but in the context of Woman and Child is she to be read as the mother? There is not enough detail to know what she is wearing. Moreover, although the young child hugs Mathilde, her eyes express a slight skepticism rather than the confidence one would expect. Woman and Child actually has two subjects, for the paint surface is as significant as the imagery. The canvas was intentionally left unfinished (it is signed), suggesting that the artist wanted the viewer to luxuriate in the paint\u2019s physicality. Its surface consists of neutral-colored passages of underpaint as well as areas finished to varying degrees. Cassatt varied her approach, using sweeping strokes, wiggles, parallel lines, and even rubbing out the pigment. The canvas also offers insight into the artist\u2019s working methodology. Typical of an academically trained artist, the faces are the most fully realized. Yet Cassatt built up her three-dimensional forms, first drawing in cobalt blue a quick, sure outline, than applying strokes one over another so that her figures simultaneously suggest solidity and movement. Cassatt had been criticized for her defective drawing by her teachers, who considered her approach slovenly. Today we realize how brilliant a draftsman she was. Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy Child and Woman and Child document Cassatt\u2019s importance to both American and French painting.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "It is said that it was George Bellows who first suggested to William Preston Harrison that Carroll should be represented in his collection and ROBERT HENRI who actually urged the commission that resulted in the painting Lady in Blue. This seems plausible since Carroll knew both artists from Woodstock. In fact, Bellows was Carroll\u2019s neighbor. The residence of the Ash Can artists prompted Woodstock modernists to become more concerned with realism.Encouraged by Andrew Dasburg, Carroll had experimented with abstraction, creating cubist still-life paintings similar to the arrangement of tulips and sheet music that he incorporated into the composition of Lady in Blue. Carroll\u2019s treatment of the figure as a series of cylinders no doubt was also influenced by the work of Cézanne and of Fernand Léger (1881-1955) and the other French purists. The compression of space into a series of overlapping planes and an emphasis on curving lines describing the figure, chair, and flowers reflect Carroll\u2019s fascination with abstract line, an interest that critics sometimes thought too decorative. Color is limited to a cool palette of tin blue for the dress and gray for the background.The painting\u2019s archaic quality is in keeping with the strong interest of some modernists in American folk art during the late 1910s and early 1920s. The figure\u2019s stiff, primitive character may also have been due the fact that it was based on an old photograph, which may also explain the painting\u2019s monochromatic palette. Lady in Blue is a portrait of William Preston Harrison\u2019s mother, Sophonisba Grayson Preston (c. 1834-1876), who was descended from the Puritans. Harrison suggested that the painting be titled Lady in Blue to avoid any criticism that might arise if a portrait of one of his relatives were installed in the museum. Regardless of the identity of the figure, the painting is of a type with the other images of single figures painted by Carroll in the 1920s.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Inness apparently cared very little about the titles of his paintings. It is possible that many were titled by the executors of his estate and organizers of his memorial exhibition and that some of his works were even signed and dated after his death. During the early twentieth century dealers often gave to his paintings what they felt were more poetic titles. When listed in the catalogue of the executor\u2019s sale, this painting was entitled Near My Studio, Milton and dated 1882. Its similarity in technique and motif to paintings of 1882, such as June (Brooklyn Museum), does seem greater than its resemblance to most paintings of 1886. The painting\u2019s most striking feature, its firm structure of horizontal and vertical elements and their careful balance, might on the one hand seem to favor the later dating, since this principle of synthetic composition is strongest in the works of the artist\u2019s final ten years. On the other hand, this concept first seems to emerge as a governing principle in his paintings of 1882. The painting\u2019s very deliberate structure was advanced for 1882 and even 1886 and may be considered among the earliest works organized according to such a conspicuously geometrical scheme. It is cut into equal quadrants by the horizon halfway up the picture surface and the central vertical line of the gap in the trees and its corresponding reflection halfway across the surface. The trees are arranged at measured intervals to add a rhythm to this balance. It is noteworthy, however, that Inness shortened the tall tree on the right, perhaps to avoid the monotony of too close a symmetry.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Soon after her arrival in Los Angeles in late 1928 Hessova began this view of the old City Hall, just before it was demolished early in 1929. The Richardsonian Romanesque structure was erected in 1888 at Broadway Street between Second and Third streets in what was originally the civic center of the city. With the completion of the new City Hall in 1927, the structure was considered obsolete and in an inappropriate location and was torn down.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1883 Carlsen exhibited for the first time at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. At this point he was still a rising young artist, but definitely a successful one. Although it is a still life of game, which were common among Carlsen\u2019s mature work, the museum\u2019s picture was painted before the artist developed his characteristic style during the coming half, decade. The painting\u2019s strong contrasts, rich chiaroscuro, and bold brushwork mark it as an early work, unlike the softly atmospheric, smoothly painted still-life canvases of his mature style. Nevertheless, it is a masterful painting, executed with economy and finesse. In its strongly asymmetrical arrangement and clear sense of pictorial geometry it reveals the essential qualities of Carlsen\u2019s approach to, still life.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "In her list of her husband\u2019s paintings included in Royal Cortissoz\u2019s book Arthur B. Davies (1931), Dr. Virginia M. Davies assigned this painting to 1908. However, this list is not always accurate. Davies rarely dated his paintings himself and did not develop in a linear manner, so the dates of many of his works have never been clearly determined.Pastoral Dells and Peaks relates to Davies\u2019s experience of the American West. In 1905 he traveled to Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and California and made several oil sketches of the dramatic, high-peaked mountains. After this trip West he abandoned the more domestic, arcadian landscapes of his earlier pastorals in favor of looming, powerful mountain ranges. It was Davies\u2019s memory of the Sierras and the soaring evergreens that inspired the background composition of Pastoral Dells and Peaks, although the artist simplified the setting, reducing its specificity.Davies was acquainted with ancient art and mythology and had visited southern Italy and Greece in 1897, 1910, and 1911. He often depicted his figures as classically robed shepherds and herders. While this scene probably was not intended to illustrate a specific story, it recalls the myth of Io, a beautiful maiden who was turned into a heifer for being loved by Jupiter. Davies follows the tradition of Greek vase painting by presenting the female figures in a paler color than the male figures. In 1908 the artist began to arrange his figures in dancers\u2019 poses in long, friezelike processions along a shallow foreground in what he referred to as \"continuous compositions.\" Pastoral Dells and Peaks does not have as many figures, nor is it as stringently composed along a processional line as Davies\u2019s more mature paintings from about 1913. Consequently, it may be an early example of Davies\u2019s continuous composition, perhaps inspired by one of his trips to Greece. So Pastoral Dells and Peaks may date as early as 1908 but probably not later than 1911.",

      "curator notes" : "The collector William Preston Harrison purchased Pedro directly from Luks after examining all the works in his studio. He was delighted with the acquisition, considering it a prime museum piece and definitely portraying a modern character. Harrison even preferred it to the artist\u2019s The Polish Dancer, c. 1927 (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia), which had been exhibited at the Los Angeles Museum\u2019s Pan-American exhibition in 1925-26 and which Harrison thought to be one of the greatest works in the show. His purchase of the painting out of the artist\u2019s studio may explain why the painting was not mentioned in any of the early literature on Luks.Luks painted the café scene in a somber palette of metallic blue, gray, dark brown, and black. It is enriched by a bravura surface, the paint being laid on so thickly and with such flat, broad strokes that the artist probably built it up with a palette knife. The brushwork is almost coarse in appearance, a treatment complementary to the low-life character that Luks portrayed. As Harrison so perceptively noted, the painting is a \"character study\" of \"a queer looking type of chap with guitar alongside.\"",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Although Miller usually depicted his women in shops, he occasionally presented them in other public places, such as an art museum. He sometimes would take his students to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a Saturday morning to examine works of art firsthand. This painting depicts such an excursion, for the model was one of Miller\u2019s students, Dorothea Schwarcz Greenbaum (b. 1893), who would later become a sculptor. As she recalled, \"Although we would pay homage to Titian and Rubens, most of our time was spent in the gloomy basement, studying the casts of Greek sculpture. He knew every fold in the draperies of the figures from the Parthenon and could draw them from memory. I do not know why he was a painter and not a sculptor-all his teaching led in that direction.\" Miller filled a large part of the scene with a huge Corinthian capital that vies in importance with the figure. Other classical objects are partially visible, and the model rests her arm on the edge of a Roman sarcophagus. The setting of this painting may be the then newly opened Cloisters of the museum, but Miller did not render the ancient objects literally enough for them to be identified definitely as works in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection.Woman in Sculpture Hall summarizes Miller\u2019s mature art for it demonstrates two of his obsessions: modern woman and antique sculpture. Greenbaum is presented as a typical Miller woman, somewhat chubby, with a round face, large eyes, and full lips, wearing the usual \"shopper\" attire -- a fashionable overcoat, beaded necklace, and cloche -- with handbag at her side. The museum setting may have been chosen as a vehicle for Miller to express more openly his respect for classical art. Once Miller adopted the shopper image, he rarely referred to antique motifs, even in his nudes. Instead, he conceived his women as sculpture, painting them fully modeled and like stone works of art. The artist described this painting\u2019s masses as \"falling in two columns.\" Miller also seems to have purposely limited his palette to dull beiges and oranges, alluding to the color of stone. With such a color scheme he was able to present his two interests in a single, unified image.",

      "curator notes" : "From 1916 to 1922 Seyffert produced a number of major canvases devoted to the nude, and these were so well received when they were exhibited throughout the country that they were usually immediately acquired for major museums. The most modernist works Seyffert was ever to produce, these canvases were no doubt influenced by the nude studies painted by his friend Arthur B. Caries. Both men used the same model, beautiful red-haired Grace Vernon, better known as \"Bobby,\" who would later become Seyffert\u2019s second wife. In several paintings Seyffert placed Bobby in highly decorative interiors with an ornate oriental screen, panel, or drape as a backdrop. Her body was treated as a single form and her extremities generalized or attenuated. In The Lacquer Screen, 1918 (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia), the curves of the nude echo the calligraphic lines in the Chinese coromandel screen behind her, but in Nude with Chinese Background the figure is more abstracted, her linear body contrasting with the curving lines depicting the lohans (enlightened disciples of the Buddha) on the background panel. By stylizing the figure and using a creamy ivory, Seyffert accentuated the woman\u2019s sensuous flesh. She appears almost luminous, the shadows on her skin colored by softer tints of the deep burgundy and green in the drapery and the earth-colored panel that surround her.The painting was altered by the artist after it was first exhibited. When shown at the Pennsylvania Academy annual in 1919, it was entitled Silver Screen, after the burnished silver screen behind the figure. Seyffert decided to repaint the background in about 1920, incorporating a much more elaborate panel, somewhat like the one in The Lacquer Screen. He painted the background in large, sweeping strokes, and the lohans seem to take on a life of their own. William Preston Harrison, who bought the painting from the artist, had seen the work in both its original and altered states.",

      "curator notes" : "Around 1910 Hassam began depicting single female figures set in comfortable domestic interiors. The critic Royal Cortissoz referred to these paintings as the \"window series,\" since the figure either sits or stands in front of or next to a window through which sunlight streams into a room. Often the window provides an unobstructed view of the city, but occasionally, as here, a drapery filters the light or even obstructs the view. Usually little of the room is shown, except for a highly polished table, which reflects the sunlight, and upon which is set a delicate vase of fresh flowers, a tea set, platter of fruit, or an objet d\u2019art. The woman is never very active but instead is engrossed in a book, thoughtful contemplation, or quiet examination of an object. Often, as in this painting and Tanagra, 1918 (National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), the woman is dressed in a loose fitting costume. Tanagra is the window-series painting most closely related to Strawberry Tea Set, sharing the similarity of the woman\u2019s costume, the horizontal composition, and the woman\u2019s fascination with an object that she holds in her hand. In these paintings Hassam came close to the studio productions of the Boston school painters and their depictions of upper-class women living comfortably in their elegant houses. Hassam differed from them in his emphasis on mood, which he conveyed through the figure\u2019s introspective attitude and evocative lighting. In his delineation of form Hassam was more conservative in the window series than in his flag paintings of the same period. This is especially true of Strawberry Tea Set, where the figure is slightly larger than in most of the other window paintings. Hassam rendered her as quite solid by modeling the form with heavy brushstrokes and manipulating the filtered light. Much less conservative was the palette, as Hassam daringly carried out the composition in a brilliant bluish green, ocher, an electric purple for highlights, and a pure white.",

      "curator notes" : "Artists actively participated in the numerous efforts to raise money for the Allied cause during World War I. As part of the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive, New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue was transformed into an art gallery during October 1918. Paintings devoted to the different Allied nations were displayed in shop windows. During this period Luks was inspired to paint a series of war-related compositions.The Czechoslovakian march through Siberia and the Czechoslovakian drive for independence during the war were causes célèbres that were repeatedly headlined in the newspapers. During the war Czech troops joined the Russians to fight on the side of the Allies. With the withdrawal of Russia from fighting after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litowsk in 1918, the Czechs were forced to leave Russia. They marched through Siberia and despite many impediments caused by poor weather and adverse political conditions reached Vladivostok in May 1918. There they boarded ships to journey to France, where they were to join other Allied forces. Luks depicted these soldiers arriving in Vladivostok.Luks no doubt became involved in the Czech cause through his friendship with the sculptor Gutzon Borglum (1871-1941), who had became closely involved in the Czech cause and even permitted his home in Stamford, Connecticut, to be used as a military base for the training of American-born Czech volunteers. Luks visited Borglum during this time and once joined him in painting posters to raise funds for the camp. Although Luks did not see the Czech army advancing in Siberia, he may have observed new soldiers practicing marching and attacking. He depicted the camp in Connecticut at least once, in Czechoslovakians in American Camp Celebrating Their Recognition as a Country, 1918 (unlocated; exhibited Allied War Salon, American Art Association Galleries, New York, 1918). Such an experience enabled Luks to become familiar with the Czech uniforms as depicted in Czech-slovak Chieftain, 1919 (Newark [N.J.] Museum), and also the new country\u2019s flag. Although the red-andwhite striped flag Luks delineated in the museum\u2019s painting is not the design eventually selected for the national flag, it is the one depicted by Henry Rittenberg (1879-1969) in his painting of the Czech army that was carried down Fifth Avenue during the celebrations in October 1918.This is the only major war scene Luks painted that he could not have witnessed firsthand. He based his painting on a photograph and description of the actual event told to him by a Lieutenant Frank Danielovsky. Danielovsky was one of the select dignitaries asked to participate in the Czechoslovak Day celebrations along Fifth Avenue on October 3, 1918. Luks inscribed in the lower-left corner of the painting that Danielovsky was his source, but at some unknown time the inscription was painted over. Although Luks could have painted Czechoslovakian Army Entering Vladivostok, Siberia, in 1918 as early as May, he may have painted it as late as October, after the Czech Day celebrations of the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive. It certainly was finished by the time of the Allied War Salon in December.In his usual bold brushwork Luks depicted the long column of Czech soldiers marching behind their leader on a cold winter day. The scene is simple, reduced to a central horizontal band of figures on a slight diagonal, with the background consisting of a few buildings. The composition of the scene relates to Luks\u2019s other war paintings of marching figures, The Blue Devils on Fifth Avenue, 1917 (Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.), and The Bersaglieri, 1918 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The overall impression is less agitated, however, due to the larger and broader areas of color. The palette is intense, with a cool, white, snowy foreground against a brilliant blue sky and touches of flaming oranges in the flag and distant buildings.",

      "label" : "As one of the most important ashcan realists of the early-twentieth century, Luks focused on contemporary life, recording people and events that he had witnessed. This large World War I scene is one of the few exceptions. During the war the Czechs were one of many East European ethnic groups striving for national independence: their efforts became a cause celebre that was repeatedly headlined in the press. Luks probably became involved in Czech issues through a friend, sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who had offered his Connecticut home as a base for training American-born Czech volunteers. During the war, Czechs brigades joined the Russian army to fight for the Allies. After the Russian peace agreement in 1918 they were to be moved to the port city of Vladivostok, whence they would sail to join the western front. During their 5,000-mile trek through Siberia, they rebuffed Russian attempts to disarm them and defeated the Bolsheviks in several skirmishes. Their journey and arrival in Vladivostok were well covered by the newspapers. Luks based his composition on a now-lost photograph by a Czech officer; in it he employed his characteristic strong, broad brushwork. His gray-blue palette underscored the extreme cold and inclement weather the soldiers endured. The red-and-white flag is not the design eventually selected as the Czech national banner but was the one used in 1918. The frame is an early-twentieth-century adaptation of the Venetian style that was the genesis of the type used for many American impressionist paintings. Its simplicity and flatness act as excellent foils for the charge brushwork of the painting.",

      "curator notes" : "During the early 1920s Costigan\u2019s characteristic themes and painting style emerged. In his most important canvases of this decade, such as Landscape with Figures, he depicted a peasant mother with a child and goats or other farm animals walking through a forest glade. Costigan used his wife, Ida Blessin (b. 1894), an accomplished sculptress, and their five children as models. Despite financial problems, which must have made life on the farm difficult, Costigan idealized rural life, conveying in his pictures a quiet, pastoral peacefulness. Removed from nearby New York City, Orangeburg became Costigan\u2019s Barbizon.Despite the calm, soothing quality of his subjects, Costigan\u2019s paintings of the 1920s were alive with energy, created by his almost incessant movement of pigment and flickering color. Landscape with Figures is a superb example of Costigan\u2019s work with its heavily encrusted surfaces, at times almost one-eighth inch thick. With a palette knife and the fullest of brushes he created impastoed passages that appear to be woven skeins of dripped pigment. His palette is equally charged: flecks of brilliant white, red, orange, magenta, yellow, green, dark blue, and brown emerge from a generally pale blue tonality. While the overall palette of Landscape with Figures is slightly sweeter than usual for this period, his paintings of the 1920s always glow with a variety of intense, warm hues. Costigan\u2019s treatment is a late and extreme manifestation of American impressionism, characterized not only by a decorative quality but by a vigor of paint and light.This flickering of light and paint suggests an atmosphere alive with the movement and spirit of nature. The source for this transcendental mood-as well as a decorative quality-may have been one of Costigan\u2019s favorite paintings, The Hermit, 1908, by JOHN S. SARGENT, which Costigan often studied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both artists presented alandscape in which rich foliage and sunlight animate the scene and make it difficult to distinguish the figures from their setting. The figures literally as well as metaphorically become one with nature.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits.

By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph.

American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Ada M. Sanberg (1885-1947) met William Preston Harrison in Chicago in 1910 and married him in 1915. Theirs was the story of a poor girl marrying a rich man, and possibly because of this circumstance the couple eventually moved to Los Angeles. They had one child, Carter Preston.Henri was supposed to paint the portrait in the summer of 1924, at the same time that WAYMAN ADAMS was originally scheduled to paint Mr. Harrison\u2019s portrait, but Henri\u2019s trip to Los Angeles was delayed until February of the following year. The artist was never very anxious to accept portrait commissions and viewed them mainly as a source of income. Because Harrison had been a strong supporter of his art, he probably felt he could not refuse the commission. Henri\u2019s sentiment notwith-standing, the portrait is a good example of the artist\u2019s late style. Instead of the thick, robust paint surface of his earlier paintings, this portrait has a thinner and flatter appearance.Henri\u2019s portrayal of Ada Harrison is somewhat conservative, probably due to her social prominence and to the fact that the work was intended to hang in the museum next to Adams\u2019s portrait of her husband. Mrs. Harrison was a large woman, and although Henri did not falsify this aspect of her appearance, he did give her an air of dignity. He minimized Mrs. Harrison\u2019s bulk somewhat by showing her in a black dress partially covered by a furtrimmed, deep orange wrap. She holds a large, feathered fan. In his early paintings of dancers Henri often included such fans. The fan does not contradict the image of Mrs. Harrison\u2019s respectability but does add an important color note to this basically dark painting.Harrison noted in 1935 that his wife had become the victim of endless criticism because of the portrait. He felt that much of it was due to other women\u2019s jealousy over its being in a public museum and regretted not having had the sitter\u2019s identity remain anonymous. Harrison was dismayed with this problem partly because he viewed the painting as a superb example of Henri\u2019s art rather than primarily as a portrait of his wife.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Guy Pène du Bois, Shops, 25.7.3OverviewShops demonstrates that du Bois had fully developed his mature style and imagery by 1922. Two of his typical, fashionably attired women stop before a store so that one of them can adjust her stockings. Such a private act performed in a public place demonstrates the importance of appearances to flappers and the superficiality of their chic life-style. Du Bois\u2019s women always appear doll-like with the same mannered physical features-sleek, curvaceous outlines, rounded faces, and exceptionally tiny feet. Such stylization precludes any sense of individuality. Above the awning across the top of the picture du Bois printed his name and that of his wife, Floy (Florence Sherman Dun, can). Besides being a clever signature, the inscription may indicate that du Bois\u2019s wife served as his model.Shops won the Third Museum Prize when it was shown at the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings at the Los Angeles Museum. One critic considered the painting very French in its light, gay spirit. Its rich colors and brilliant sunlight surely contributed to this impression. Shops was one of several paintings from the PanAmerican Exhibition to be parodied at the annual fakir celebration of the California Art Club, with Luvena Vysekal (d. 1954), artist and wife of EDOUARD VYSEKAL, depicting GUY PENNY DE PEEP as a striped awning above two pairs of legs.On the back of the panel is an incomplete painting of a woman (see illustration).",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Throughout his career Carroll was fondest of painting the female figure, especially the nude. Parthenope served as a vehicle for the artist\u2019s exploration of progressive ideas. Indeed, it was the painting\u2019s modern character that attracted attention when it was exhibited at the Los Angeles Museum in the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings in 1925-26. At that time controversy arose over whether the coveted Balch prize should be given to a conservative or a modern painting. The result was a compromise, with the award being shared between Where Nature\u2019s God Hath Wrought, 1925 (LACMA; q.v.), by WILLIAM WENDT and Parthenope. Consequently Carroll\u2019s painting received much attention from the press. Most critics appreciated his harmonious color and fluid line. Antony Anderson of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"never was rhythm of line and form more alluringly rendered,\" and Vennerstrom Cannon of the La Jolla Journal thought it remarkable and worth the excursion to Los Angeles. Others could not comprehend Carroll\u2019s modernism, one critic referring to his \"haulking maidens\" set against \"sausage-like hills.\" It was even parodied in comic versions created for the annual fakir celebration of the California Art Club. E. Roscoe Shrader referred to his version which also appeared as a cartoon in a local newspaperas Bare \u2019n\u2019 Soapy, portraying the maidens as women taking a shower and attaching an actual shower nozzle and soap dish to the canvas.Parthenope exemplifies certain aesthetic and pseudoscientific ideas held by progressive artists during the period. Carroll\u2019s tendency to simplify his figures into solid geometric shapes recalls similar neoclassical figures painted in the 1920s by the purists and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). Since Carroll usually focused on a single figure, he may have felt the need for a theoretical basis for the design of this, his most complex figure composition. To assure a wellproportioned and harmonious arrangement, Carroll constructed the composition on the design principles of the \"whirling square rectangle\" as propounded by Jay Hambidge (1867-1924) and his disciple George Bellows. The arrangement of figures across the foreground plane and the placement of their arms and headsespecially those of the woman at center with tilted head and shoulders-accords precisely with Hambidge\u2019s theory, in particular his emphasis on diagonals to create controlled, rhythmic movement. The arcing lines of the softly rolling, distant mountains repeat the curves and rhythms of the figures\u2019 anatomy and drapery. Such a treatment of the landscape, although idealized, is similar to that in Bellows\u2019s Woodstock landscape with figures, Picnic, 1924 (Peabody Institute of the City of Baltimore), which also was based on Hambidge\u2019s theory of dynamic symmetry.Hambidge\u2019s concept was founded on principles expounded by the ancient Greeks, and this classical origin may have encouraged Carroll\u2019s use of a classical motif. There are several legends about Parthenope, in one of which she is a siren who, with her sisters, threw herself into the sea, which many have been Carroll\u2019s inspiration. Such an allusion to antiquity and the idealized presentation were not typical of Carroll\u2019s art.Antony Anderson referred to the painting\u2019s \"synchronism [sic] of color,\" and its rainbow effect suggests that Carroll may have applied to Parthenope some of the pseudoscientific color theories then popular. The drape of each of the three foreground figures is painted a single intense hue-red, blue, or green-and these colors as well as the yellow in the middle distance constitute the painting\u2019s palette. Carroll merely added white to create pastel tints for the background and skin. Even the short, striated brushwork in the background suggests that he sought to present his colors as if seen through a prism.",

      "curator notes" : "William Preston Harrison (1869-1940) was the pioneer collector of American art in Los Angeles, and his collection, given to the Los Angeles Museum during the 1920s and 1930s, formed the basis of its early holdings. He was also an important collector of French art.Son of Carter H. Harrison, five-time mayor of Chicago, and brother of Carter Harrison, also a Chicago mayor, Preston Harrison came to Los Angeles in 1918 after having been involved in the family\u2019s real estate ventures and serving as editor and publisher of the Chicago Times. He settled in Los Angeles with his wife, Ada Sanberg Harrison (see entry under ROBERT HENRI), and although he lived on the West Coast until his death, he maintained close ties with the Midwest. As did his brother in Chicago, Preston Harrison became involved in local cultural affairs: he served on the board of governors of the Los Angeles Museum (at the time of his death he was vice-president of the board) and was active in the Los Angeles Art Association and the Friends of Art of the Huntington Library.From its inception this portrait was intended for presentation to the museum, and it hung in the Harrison Room along with other paintings donated by the Harrisons. The portrait was painted in New York in June 1924. Typical of Adams\u2019s painting method, it was completed in one day. Adams delineated the figure with long, sure strokes and the background with equally broad brushwork. Such rapid execution is characteristic of a student of Chase and Henri, and Henri may have suggested to Harrison that Adams be the one to paint his portrait.Adams portrayed Harrison with dignity, befitting his station. Harrison\u2019s importance as a major patron of the arts is alluded to by the inclusion of a portrait of a crowned figure hanging on the wall behind him. Harrison wears a dark blue business suit and in his hands are a pair of gloves, a cane, and a hat. Every aspect of the painting evokes respectability and decorum. Adams was a master of facial characterization, and he presented Harrison as a generous, elderly man.Although admired by artists, the portrait received some criticism locally. The attacks by Los Angeles society were probably due mostly to jealousy over the portrait\u2019s installation in a public museum, but even Harrison thought that the painting might be called \"Old Grouchy.\"",

He was also an important collector of French art.Son of Carter H. Harrison, five-time mayor of Chicago, and brother of Carter Harrison, also a Chicago mayor, Preston Harrison came to Los Angeles in 1918 after having been involved in the family\u2019s real estate ventures and serving as editor and publisher of the Chicago Times. He settled in Los Angeles with his wife, Ada Sanberg Harrison (see entry under ROBERT HENRI), and although he lived on the West Coast until his death, he maintained close ties with the Midwest. As did his brother in Chicago, Preston Harrison became involved in local cultural affairs: he served on the board of governors of the Los Angeles Museum (at the time of his death he was vice-president of the board) and was active in the Los Angeles Art Association and the Friends of Art of the Huntington Library.From its inception this portrait was intended for presentation to the museum, and it hung in the Harrison Room along with other paintings donated by the Harrisons. The portrait was painted in New York in June 1924. Typical of Adams\u2019s painting method, it was completed in one day. Adams delineated the figure with long, sure strokes and the background with equally broad brushwork. Such rapid execution is characteristic of a student of Chase and Henri, and Henri may have suggested to Harrison that Adams be the one to paint his portrait.Adams portrayed Harrison with dignity, befitting his station. Harrison\u2019s importance as a major patron of the arts is alluded to by the inclusion of a portrait of a crowned figure hanging on the wall behind him. Harrison wears a dark blue business suit and in his hands are a pair of gloves, a cane, and a hat. Every aspect of the painting evokes respectability and decorum. Adams was a master of facial characterization, and he presented Harrison as a generous, elderly man.Although admired by artists, the portrait received some criticism locally. The attacks by Los Angeles society were probably due mostly to jealousy over the portrait\u2019s installation in a public museum, but even Harrison thought that the painting might be called \"Old Grouchy.\"",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Nothing is known about the identity of the sitters and little is known with certainty about the history of the painting, although the donor stated that it was painted in New York State. The style of the apparel worn by the sitters indicates a date in the late 1840s. The patrons of the itinerant portraitists of the period insisted on realistic likenesses. The artist of this portrait paid relatively little attention to detail in the softly painted clothing and furniture but concentrated on the strikingly more plastic and fully developed physiognomies. Although a close family resemblance marks the sitters, each is described as a distinct individual. In most American primitive portraits the subjects are arranged across the picture plane, side by side. The vertical arrangement of this painting is unusual, as is the unconventional position of the boy standing on the sofa. His position is used in an interesting way to achieve a characterization of the psychological relationships within the family Whereas his sister is enfolded within the protecting arm of the mother, the boy stands independently, higher than the mother and apparently self-sufficient, as he leans comfortably on her shoulder. It is conceivable that the boy\u2019s likeness is a memorial portrait.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "As in the artist\u2019s The Moon Path, 1910-15 (private collection), a ghostly nude figure dances on a pool of moonlit water. Like the nude figures that recline on the ledges in some of Daingerfield\u2019s Grand Canyon paintings, this dancer is symbolic, in this case of the quality and poetry of moonlight. An early champion of Ryder, Daingerfield was a symbolist painter who evoked concepts and feelings through his imaginary subjects. As Ryder and Blakelock tried to do, Daingerfield sought, in The Temple Dancer, to achieve richly colored, enamellike surfaces by the extensive use of glazes.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Trained as a lawyer and artist, Edward Wheelwright (1824-1900) is known today for his writings on art. He was born into a prestigious Boston family and educated at the finest schools, including Harvard, where he was a classmate of Hunt. Well traveled and erudite, Wheelwright turned to painting, first studying art around 1850 in the Parisian atelier of Eugène Cicéri (1813-1890), a landscape painter. Five years later, inspired by Hunt, he returned to France and persuaded Millet to become his teacher. Their student-teacher association was quite formal, the only one of its kind to be made by an American with Millet. However, Wheelwright never seriously pursued the career of an artist. After his return to the United States, he turned his attention to other aspects of art, becoming a critic for the Atlantic Monthly in the late 1870s. He actively promoted the reputation of Millet in this country, through his article \"Personal Recollections of Jean-Franqois Millee\", of 1876 in the Atlantic Monthly and through his assisting the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in raising funds for the purchase of paintings by Millet. In June 1856 Wheelwright returned home after spending nine months in Barbizon. He joined Hunt at Newport, becoming part of the intimate circle of artists and writers around Hunt and his family. It was at this time that Hunt painted his portrait. With his return to the United States, Hunt entered the field of portraiture, and Wheelwright\u2019s bust is an early example of Hunt\u2019s extensive work in that genre. Some of his best portraits were created during his Newport years. Although he received numerous commissions, he often painted his friends. Hunt\u2019s handling of the portrait reveals his French training, in particular the influence of Thomas Couture and Millet. The overall effect is one of softness, in contrast to the harsh clarity typical of mid-nineteenth-century American portraits. Hunt built up Wheelwright\u2019s face with light and dark passages of color, including different shades of pinks, roses, and oranges, vigorously applied in small strokes over a warm underdrawing. The head is quite plastic, but its contour is blurred. The warm tonal palette of browns is carried through into the background, although less densely.",

      "curator notes" : "The Trio typifies Williams\u2019s romantic, arcadian figure paintings. Inspired by the fetes galantes of Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), Williams dressed his female subjects in flowing gowns and elaborate coiffures of the rococo period and placed them in a forest setting pursuing some form of leisurely merriment. The activity is always sweet and innocent. Here two lovely young maidens collect flowers as the third figure, in the back, plays her guitar and serenades them. Following the example of Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886) and his highly impastoed surfaces, Williams applied his paint thickly, layering the glazes with scumbling so that the surface appears to be encrusted. He restricted the palette to the deep, sumptuous hues of the forest: oranges, ochers, greens, and browns.The entire painting has an effervescence as light flickers over the jewellike surface. In paintings such as this Williams carried on the late nineteenth-century American romantic spirit of Blakelock and Daingerfield.",

      "curator notes" : "Rustic farm life not only furnished financial support for Fuller during the 1860s but also served as the main inspiration for his late landscapes. Even more than Millet and the other Barbizon painters he admired, Fuller viewed farm life in idyllic terms. His pastorals often consist of a small figure standing to the extreme side of a broad, open field. Girl with Turkeys is similar to Turkey Pasture in Kentucky, 1878 (Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Va.) in which a single female stands to the left in the foreground near the flock of turkeys she is tending. During the last several years of his life Fuller created a number of such farm scenes, which reveal his rural New England heritage. As with all his pastorals, the activity depicted is of minor importance, for the open field with its light and air provide the vehicle for the artist to express the harmony of an idyllic rustic life. Fuller painted the entire scene in his typical earthy, but nuanced palette of muted brown, beige, ocher, and khaki green. His handling of the paint was equally suggestive; the strokes, often applied one layer over another, and the scribbled effect of his brush handle drawn over the wet paint in the foliage suggest the activity of the trees, but the rest of the scene is enveloped in a delicate haze as the soft strokes of the atmosphere blur all outlines. Like other advanced artists of the period, Fuller was as much interested in paint manipulation as in representation. Contemporary critics recognized Fuller\u2019s poetic nature and his place in American culture. When this painting was exhibited at Doll and Richards an unidentified reviewer astutely noted: It is with the work of Fuller as it is with the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson. It matters little what one reads of Emerson ... its influence is an indefinite exhilaration-or, rather, inspiration; the definite things he says are secondary in their value. So it is with Fuller. His pictures are impossible as nature but beyond value as dignifying and ennobling impulses. In the present instance the vague, phantasmal girl and her wandering turkeys, the shadowy hut close under the thick deep forest, the hazy shapes of trees ... and the dull yellow sky, while none of them could be considered possible in the smallest degree, are yet details of a whole which is singularly impressive. In the Fuller memorial volume Girl with Turkeys was dated to the artist\u2019s last year. The painting has a label from A. A. Walker of 594 Washington Street, who was a colorman located at such an address in Boston from 1877 to 1880. When it was sold at auction less than thirty years after its creation, the painting received a record price for a Fuller painting and the second highest price ever brought by a contemporary American picture at auction.",

When Girl with Turkeys was exhibited in Boston a reviewer praised, \u201cthe vague, phantasmal girl ... thick deep forest, [and] the hazy shapes of trees\u201d as evoking dignified and ennobling impulses. Due to financial circumstances the artist was forced to spend much of his adult life managing the family farm at Deerfield, Massachusetts, so he was well versed in the habits of rural life and the many moods of nature. This painting, one of his larger farm scenes, is typical in its absence of details and narrow tonal palette. Despite its delicate mood of contemplation, the painting is quite rich in its muted colors and varied brushwork. At a time when Massachusetts and many other areas of the United States were experiencing increasing industrialization and urbanization, this pastoral was an idyllic hymn to lost innocence.The handsome frame by Carrig-Rohane was added to the painting in 1924. Carrig-Rohane, the leading frame maker in Boston, was renowned for carefully toning the gilding to harmonize with each painting. The founder of the frameshop, painter Herman Dudley Murphy, established the practice of carving the firm\u2019s name and date into the back of each frame. The inscription signified that the frame was one of a kind, rather than mass-produced.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1937 Bouché won the Treasury Section competition to paint a mural on the rear wall of the auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building in Washington, D.C. This commission was one of the most sought-after awards of the New Deal projects and was covered extensively by the press. Bouché created a three-part mural of the landscape of the Far West (see illustration). The figure in The Mural Assistant sits in front of the incomplete Interior Building mural. The figure\u2019s placement is somewhat ambiguous since the mural does not at first appear to be a painting. Although there are photographs in the Bouché papers of the artist sitting on a ladder in front of his mural, just as in the painting, the figure in The Mural Assistant is not the artist.According to Bouché\u2019s daughter, she was supposed to pose for this painting but became dizzy and was replaced by her uncle, Milton Wright. Published accounts give a different version of the circumstances, however: Bouché, who was always ready to see the humor in ordinary scenes, thought his small brother-inlaw seemed ludicrous sitting atop the ladder and so decided to paint him. Wright is situated before the center of the landscape where several deer are sketched in. The figures of the Native American and White Man overlooking the land in the extreme left of the mural are not included. Nor had Bouché yet drawn in the medallions with the symbols of the Department of the Interior in the border along the bottom of the mural. Its incomplete state gave Bouché the opportunity to paint the landscape background of the easel painting in broad, full strokes. One can see in their application the artist\u2019s love of the sensuous qualities of the medium, which brought life to Bouché\u2019s seemingly drab genre scenes. This is especially true in paintings such as The Mural Assistant, which has a palette limited primarily to quiet grays, beiges, and ochers.",

In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",

      "curator notes" : "The mid-1940s through the 1950s marked the period of Rockwell\u2019s most important paintings, when he transcended pure illustration without relinquishing a clearly understood, often humorous narrative. The transformation was apparent in the paintings he made for the Saturday Evening Post covers beginning around the mid-1940s. The change was encouraged by a new layout of the cover that separated the title from the illustration and the appointment of Ken Stuart as art editor in 1944. Stuart wanted the covers to be portraits of a nation in change. The subject of this painting could not have been more topical, since the general public only started purchasing televisions during the late 1940s.During the decade Rockwell increasingly used photographs in his preparatory work so that he could pay more attention to the setting, rather than the figures, as he had earlier. Consequently a new concern for architectural subjects, seen most often in detailed interiors, appeared in his art. He depicted architectural exteriors less frequently. By setting The New Television Set on the roof of a house, Rockwell used architecture not only to structure the composition but also to convey the contrast of the old, the house, with the new, the television. The scene epitomizes the rapid modernization of America, for the house was one of many large Victorian structures characteristic of the district around Adams Street in Los Angeles, where it was painted.Rockwell\u2019s association with Los Angeles was long and close, beginning in 1930, when he met his wife, Mary Barstow, on his first trip to the city. During the 1940s he wintered here and was artist-in-residence at Otis Art Institute (Los Angeles County Art Institute). He became friendly with his students and asked some of them to serve as his models. For The New Television Set Robert H. Horton, at the time an architecture student, posed as the television serviceman, and Jack Farman, another student, served as the model for the elderly customer.The painting was reproduced on the cover of the November 5, 1949, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. Rockwell presented the painting to Ned Crowell, a close friend who was West Coast district manager for the Curtis Publishing Company, among whose many publications was the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "Many of Russell\u2019s later canvases were of male nudes, and he considered these figure paintings to be his most significant work after the synchromies. Sometimes the nudes were depicted in a mythological guise but often they were bathers, as in Piscine. Russell was preoccupied with the heroic form of the human figure from his earliest days as an artist, when, inspired by Michelangelo, he sculpted a nude male; even the synchromies were based on the movement of the human form. In his late paintings Russell stressed the solidity of the nude\u2019s body as would a sculptor.Piscine reveals the artist\u2019s fascination with the human physique. The lack of interaction between the figures would suggest that Russell explored different aspects of the body by painting one model in four different poses and from four different angles. Russell knew that a rich palette would distract from the figures, which he intended to be the primary expressive element, and consequently Piscine is limited to dull tones of gold and bluish purples. Color was always important to Russell, however, and in his late figure painting he based his palette on what he considered to be classic colors. As do the figures in his late religious paintings, the nudes in Piscine seem to float rather than to stand solidly at the edge of the pool.Piscine was one of several paintings that the artist asked Frank L. Stevens to store for him. Unknown to Russell, Stevens buried the paintings. After Stevens\u2019s death the paintings were disinterred, and Macdonald-Wright obtained some of them, including Piscine.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Although the directions of all of Sonntag\u2019s sketching expeditions are not known, it is recorded that during the summer of 1860 he sketched in West Virginia, presumably the location of this view of the Potomac. It resembles his mature style of the 1860s and, like works in that style, is a highly ideal, conventionalized interpretation. Since few of his paintings are dated, an exact dating cannot be ascertained.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "Berlin\u2019s turn to modernism was supposedly initiated by his reading of Jerome Eddy\u2019s notable book Cubists and Post-Impressionism (1914), and his earliest abstractions are indebted to cubism. Although Berlin probably never visited France, by the 1920s cubism was well known in Los Angeles and he would have been aware of it.In this painting the figures are fused with the surrounding environment in a configuration of overlapping and intersecting faceted planes and ray lines, standard cubist devices. During the 1920s, when this canvas may have been painted, STANTON MACDONALDWRIGHT was the dominant force in Los Angeles\u2019s modernist circles. His art, although exhibiting more arabesque lines, may have influenced Berlin\u2019s treatment of the figure, especially in his use of delicate, translucent planes. The cubist art of Lorser Feitelson, who became a major progressive force in Los Angeles after his move to the West Coast in 1927, also may have served as a model for Berlin.A painting that may have directly inspired Figures is Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2), 1912 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968). Duchamp\u2019s often reproduced painting was a notorious modernist work, and it is likely that Berlin became acquainted with it through the collector Walter Arensberg, who had settled in Hollywood in the 1920s and always opened his home to artists. Arensberg did not acquire the painting until 1930, but before that time he proudly displayed a color reproduction of it. As in Duchamp\u2019s painting, Berlin\u2019s cubist analysis of movement results in an allover composition of intersecting planes and diagonal lines colored in a somber dominant hue. The dark lines are in blue with brighter, warm colors brushed in to create a translucent effect. Figures may have been one of the paintings, as was Rhythmic Forms (unlocated), in Berlin\u2019s 1924 exhibition at the Potboiler, for in an article commenting on the show, Berlin was praised for being one of the first to attempt the depiction of the fourth dimension.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "Although Bingham is known primarily for his genre images of the frontier, he also created approximately forty landscapes in which figures are only a minor element or were omitted altogether. Actually the landscapes fit well into his oeuvre, since nearly all of Bingham\u2019s narrative scenes were set out-of-doors, in locales often similar to those of his landscapes. Based on formal criteria, most of Bingham\u2019s landscapes are dated from the late 1840s and early 1850s. A View of a Lake in the Mountains has traditionally been considered a work from the years prior to Bingham\u2019s study in Düsseldorf, dating either c. 1851 or 1853-56. While A View of a Lake has motifs similar to those in Landscape with Fisherman, c. 1850 (Missouri Historical Society, Saint Louis)--the tiny figure of the fisherman and the rocky setting near a body of water--it is a much more complex and formal landscape. One authority has suggested that Bingham painted A View of a Lake in the mountains while in Germany; he is known to have done landscapes for his own satisfaction when in Düsseldorf. The landscape displays the sophisticated approach to form and space of the Düsseldorf school. Unlike his earlier landscapes in which numerous passages are amorphous and ill defined, the rocks and foliage in the foreground of A View of a Lake are sharply delineated with a crisp drawing technique and clear light. The sunlight on the right forms a pattern of alternating passages of light and shadow, a characteristic typical of Bingham\u2019s German-period figure paintings. The rocks and trees in the foreground of the landscapes of the early 1850s frame the scene, while the rocks in this mountain view are placed one behind the other to define spatial recession. In the one known landscape datable to his Düsseldorf period, Moonlight Scene: Castle on the Rhine, c. 1857-59 (private collection), Bingham adopted a hard finish and massed lights and darks in a similar manner to emphasize a progression of planes rather than a continuous recession as in his earlier landscapes. The distant rock formations appear more idealized and their stylized shapes are described by a softer, almost opalescent palette. They have been compared with Alpine scenery. Thus, the increased sophistication Bingham demonstrated in this landscape compared with those from the early 1850s suggests that the painting dates from his years in Düsseldorf or from the period immediately following his European visit.",

      "curator notes" : "When this landscape surfaced in the 1940s it bore the title The Mohawk Valley because it resembled a landscape by that name in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Newly found documentary evidence has led to the identification of the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s landscape as a painting titled Tennessee. Although contemporary references do not mention that Wyant was active in Tennessee, he may have visited the state when he was sketching in neighboring Kentucky during the late 1850s and early 1860s. In 1865 the artist traveled to Düsseldorf, and it was there in 1866 that he painted the Metropolitan\u2019s painting. The Los Angeles Museum\u2019s Landscape resembles the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Tennessee in Wyant\u2019s general approach to the mountainous landscape: taking an elevated perspective, the artist presented a broad view, delineating the meanderings of a river in the middle distance and placing to one side a single, tall tree that provides a point of entry for the viewer. Both paintings have a similar rocky ledge in the foreground on which the artist stood to view the scene, although in Tennessee the ledge is actually the escarpment of a river. Despite the similarities-many of which may have derived from traditional studio landscape devices there are enough differences to question whether the Los Angeles Museum\u2019s painting is of the same scene of the Grand Canyon of Tennessee in the Cumberland Mountains that has been identified as the site depicted in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s painting. The distant mountains in Landscape do not have the same configuration as the mountains in Tennessee, in which the gorge between Signal and Lookout Mountains formed by the Tennessee River is delineated. Although the date and size of Landscape suggest that Wyant may have intended it to be a study for Tennessee, there is no conclusive documentary evidence to prove such a link between the two paintings. Moreover, Landscape appears to be more complete in execution than a study might be. Landscape is a highly finished, tightly painted work in which a brilliantly clear atmosphere and bright colors dominate. From its earliest days, Tennessee was criticized for its subdued colors and its style linked with the Düsseldorf school. Landscape, however, demonstrates that the crisp, linear quality of the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s painting of 1866 may not have been due solely to the influence of German art. In the Los Angeles painting of the preceding year, Wyant was meticulous in his delineation of the blades of grass and occasional flower. He even conveyed the striations of the foreground rock formations. Such an exacting representation was extolled by John Ruskin and enthusiastically followed by the English critic\u2019s American disciples in the late 1850s and early 1860s. While Düsseldorf-trained artists shared with Ruskin\u2019s followers an interest in a heightened technical realism, they did not use a similar palette. English Pre-Raphaelite painters, whom Ruskin held up as exemplifying the best in art, were noted for their brilliant hues. The Düsseldorf painters were usually criticized for their cold, colorless palette. The museum\u2019s Landscape not only has a more varied and brighter palette than the somber browns and greens of the Metropolitan painting, more importantly it has the unique lavender-green combination found only in those mid-century American landscape paintings inspired by the English Pre-Raphaelites. Wyant briefly visited New York in 1857, the year of the first major showing of Pre-Raphaelite art in the United States, but it is more likely that he first came into contact with their art after his move to New York in 1863. Although it is not known exactly when in 1865 Wyant painted Landscape, most likely it was executed before his trip to Germany. Due to the lack of early, dated Wyant landscapes, it is difficult to characterize the artist\u2019s development before his European studies. If the museum\u2019s Landscape is typical of the artist\u2019s style immediately prior to his European travels, then the differences between the 1865 landscape and the larger 1866 painting demonstrate the alteration in Wyant\u2019s approach that occurred as a result of his studies with Gude. The transformation of Wyant\u2019s palette was not the only change. In the museum\u2019s Landscape Wyant depicted a more natural, almost \"accidental\" view, the type that Ruskin extolled, but in Tennessee he adopted a traditional academic approach to landscape painting and presented a grand vista centered around a waterfall in the foreground. The other major difference between the two paintings is the overall mood the artist established through the meteorological conditions depicted. The sky in Landscape is clear and calm while that in Tennessee is stormy and overcast. Wyant\u2019s emphasis on clarity and factual detail in the 1865 painting suggests an emphasis on accurate transcription, and his veiling of Tennessee in clouds and shadows reveals that subsequently, in Germany, he adopted the highly romantic approach of the Düsseldorf school.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In the 1910s Breckenridge painted and exhibited a large number of tabletop arrangements, usually including an assortment of fruit, vases, and pots. These still-life paintings became Breckenridge\u2019s primary means of experiment. He wrote that still life was \"the purest art of painting\" for \"it has no story to tell, other than that of line, form and color\" (Valley House Gallery, unpublished book, p. 64 [Archiv. Am. Art microfilm roll 2410, fr. 266]). The Altar Cloth is typical of such experiments and is also characteristic of Breckenridge\u2019s bolder style. Like many early American modernists, he was most influenced by Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) and Henri Matisse (1869-1954). He considered Cézanne to be the greatest artist of modern times, and the slightly tilted tabletop here recalls Cézanne\u2019s still lifes. The painting is indebted to Matisse\u2019s paintings of his fauve period for its brilliant color. Breckenridge did not hesitate to employ richly saturated hues of rose, emerald green, lavender, and ultramarine, even utilizing equally expressive colors in the shadows. The tall white vase in the center is framed by a green jar on the right and a white bowl and bright green cloth on the left. In typical postimpressionist fashion, Breckenridge placed the complementary color of the rose drape next to the green objects. Breckenridge often borrowed from Matisse the device of placing a painting or patterned hanging, here an altar cloth, behind the objects on the table to compromise the illusion of space by emphasizing surface pattern.During the 1910s Breckenridge often worked closely with Arthur B. Carles (1880-1952), and the two even used the same objects in their still-life compositions. Both artists shared pictorial concerns and a debt to the fauve palette of Matisse. When The Altar Cloth is compared with Carles\u2019s still-life paintings of this period an essential difference arises: no matter how bold Breckenridge is with his palette, he remains more conservative than Carles in his treatment of form. In The Altar Cloth Breckenridge did not completely relinquish traditional modeling and shading, while in his paintings Carles boldly flattened and simplified his objects. Breckenridge\u2019s modernism at this stage of his development was allied to his use of nonreferential, expressionist color. Indeed, years later Carles acknowledged Breckenridge as the one who taught him about color resonance. It was the color of GEORGE INNESS that first attracted Breckenridge to painting in the 1880s, and color was always to dominate in his more avant-garde works.The museum\u2019s painting was frequently exhibited before William Preston Harrison saw it in Chicago and acquired it in 1923. While Harrison knew that artists with an impressionist slant, such as FREDERICK CARL FRIESEKE, disliked Breckenridge\u2019s modernism, Harrison believed that Breckenridge was a fine painter with \"a style all his own.\"",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Although the form of the signature is like that used by William Chase after about 1885, several stylistic features point to a date late in Chase\u2019s Munich period (1872-78), especially the broadly brushed colored background, the working of the hair into an unruly mass extended beyond reasonable limits, and the overly strong, flat lighting with white high, lights-characteristics of Chase\u2019s Munich style, which he abandoned soon after his return to New York in 1878.By leaving parts of the composition in a conspicuously unfinished state, Chase and his American and German associates in Munich drew attention to the forceful realism in the finished portions of the face, and to the fact that the rendering was achieved in just one sitting rather than as a result of two or more sessions. For instance, in subsequent revisions the artist also would have worked in the back, ground light and shadow over the extended portion of the hair, bringing the entire painting to a state of uniform finish. The clarity of vision and economy of means that produced such realistic definition and strong characterization bear witness to the technical brilliance achieved by Chase at the Munich Academy.In 1928 the subject was identified as a violinist and in 1937 as the celebrated virtuoso and composer Pablo de Sarasate (1844-1904), who toured widely during the 1870s. Chase\u2019s subject seems older than thirty-one, Sarasate\u2019s age in 1875, although the portrait bears a general resemblance to other images of the violinist. In 1875 Sarasate would not have worn the lapel rosette of the Legion of Honor, which may have been added at a later date. The canvas may have been stored rolled up, causing a multitude of fine, horizontal cracks to appear. Chase later may have painted over the background, hair, and costume in a uniform dark tone and again signed the painting. This is the way the portrait must have appeared when Chase exhibited it early in this century. It was necessary to remove this overpainting during conservation by the museum\u2019s staff.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "Around 1928 Hiler began to omit the figures from his urban views and focus on the city\u2019s buildings as cubic forms and geometric planes. Eventually, as in Factories at Lyon, he also combined flatly painted surfaces with highly impastoed, striated areas. The textured areas often took on a life of their own, divorced from the overall scene, thereby destroying an already limited sense of painted reality. When Hiler included an occasional figure, he often presented it as a silhouette, as he did here, thereby enhancing the mysterious mood of the scene. Formally, the emphasis on textures relates to synthetic cubism while the flat, planar emphasis of the painting bears a resemblance to some of the precisionist images painted in New York in the 1920s. Not surprisingly, Hiler was a close friend of the artist Niles Spencer (1893-1952). They met in New York around 1917, and when both lived in Paris during the early 1920s they spent many hours discussing artistic issues of subject matter and geometry. However, Hiler\u2019s own abstracted paintings demonstrate a concept invented by him, which Ezra Pound dubbed \"neonaturism.\" As the artist explained in his book Why Abstract?, neonaturism was his attempt to combine design with representation, something which he thought was essential. Hiler felt that for a painting to be successful it had to demonstrate the \"physiological appeal satisfying to man\u2019s geometrical instinct through the use of strictly mathematical composition\" (\"Hiler\u2019s Neo-Naturism in Philadelphia Show,\" Art Digest 8 [November 1, 1933]: 14).The painting is inscribed with the name Cagnes, which may refer to the coastal town near Nice on the French Riviera where Hiler lived occasionally during the early 1930s, although the scene has none of the spirit of the resort town. Rather, by his emphasis on geometric, industrial imagery and use of a dark, dingy palette of brown, gray, and black, Hiler captured the spirit of Lyon, which in 1930 was one of the largest cities in France and a major chemical and engineering center.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "According to James 0. McReynolds, his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Robert Phillips McReynolds, commissioned this painting from Wendt. Its unusual proportions may indicate that it was intended for a specific location in the McReynoldses\u2019 house. The painting would have been very successful as a decorative design, the vigor of its brushwork enlivening the generally flat and rhythmic composition.",

Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "Macdonald-Wright created relatively few completely nonobjective synchromies, fearing that such work could deteriorate into \"aimless \u2018free\u2019 decoration\" (\"The Artist Speaks: Stanton Macdonald-Wright,\" Art in America 55 May 19671: 73). He preferred instead to base his color abstractions on the figure. He and Morgan Russell both greatly admired the muscular figures of Michelangelo (1475-1564) and used his powerful human forms in their paintings. Synchromy in Purple is one of many paintings in which the artist based the composition on a heroic figure. In Synchromy in Blue, 1916 (Weyhe Gallery, New York, as of 1978), the figure is presented in almost the same seated pose, its large, muscular body nearly bursting beyond the edges of the canvas.Synchromy in Purple is typical of the color abstractions Macdonald-Wright painted around 1916 and 1917. The artist purged his palette of blended tertiary colors, relying largely on the primary and secondary hues of the color spectrum-in this case using reds, blues, purples, and yellows-and often presenting them as complementary color chords. While Russell\u2019s palette had been limited to these colors as early as 1913, Macdonald-Wright did not adopt such prismatic hues until later. Unlike Russell, Macdonald-Wright employed white extensively, thereby creating paintings with a softer, more crystalline luminosity. Moreover, he did not present the colors as fractured colored planes; here he sketched in the basic contours and even some of the details of the face with arcing blue lines and applied the brilliant hues in long strokes. The white and color passages function together to suggest light and dark and consequently a modeled human body. Despite Macdonald-Wright\u2019s intentions, the color becomes almost a decorative overlay, and consequently the later synchromies such as this example appear less avant-garde. Macdonald-Wright\u2019s paintings would always retain a certain luminous delicacy, and these qualities accorded well with his later fascination with oriental philosophy and art.",

Significantly, this chord appears on the face and on the figure\u0092's muscular legs. In his Treatise on Color, completed in 1924, Macdonald-Wright described the scale of red-violet as the calm before the storm and violet as the storm itself. Red-violet thus foretells strength and action.",

      "curator notes" : "Stettheimer painted flowers throughout her life, incorporating them into her figurative compositions or using them as the focal point of her still-life paintings.Zinnias exhibits all the typical elements of a mature Stettheimer still life. A bouquet of flowers is placed beneath a festoon on a table in the center of the composition. In the 1920s Stettheimer became fascinated with the design theories of Adolfo Best-Maugard (1891-1964), whose principles of composition were based on simplicity and conventionalized, childlike images. Stettheimer\u2019s repeated use of a frontal view of a vase of flowers and drapery swag may have been related to Best-Maugard\u2019s emphasis on such motifs.Stettheimer painted the vase, background, and festoon in white with tints of pink and gray underpaint. White was her color, for she not only used it extensively in her painting as a color and to key up her palette, she also surrounded herself with white, often wearing a fringed white dress and decorating her studio in white lace and fringed drapery. The garland draped above the vase in the museum\u2019s painting alludes to her canopied bed. The vase of flowers appears to exist in a sheltered, private niche, safe from the outside world, just as Stettheimer lived in an exclusive, refined world that she created. Even the thickly impastoed surface, characteristic of Stettheimer\u2019s mature art, suggests the pure sensuosity of her maidenly, but artistically rich, life.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In the Boudoir is typical of the many informal interior scenes Frieseke painted throughout his career. Although he much preferred to paint outdoors, the American public of the 1910s more readily bought his boudoir scenes of women involved in their toilette or in some other feminine activity. The artist\u2019s wife, Sarah, better known as Sadie, usually posed as his model in their home. In this painting, as in many of Frieseke\u2019s interiors of the 1910s, the model lounges in a room decorated with elegant French rococo furniture and an oriental carpet. In contrast to the figure\u2019s restful pose, the scene is alive with decorative patterning. Frieseke\u2019s interior is similar to those by Edouard Vuillard (18681940). Both artists often presented their figures in corners of rooms, viewing them diagonally and from a slightly elevated viewpoint. The floor tilts up, flattening the space of the room and thereby emphasizing the painting as an arrangement of flat shapes and patterns. Frieseke differed from Vuillard in his tendency to present his models more intimately attired or involved in more personal activities. In Torn Lingerie, 1915 (Saint Louis Art Museum), the model reveals her lovely leg while mending her slip, and in In the Boudoir she abandons her sewing basket to stretch out comfortably on the settee, allowing her kimono to slip off and expose her shoulders and breast.The palette of Frieseke\u2019s interiors from his middle period varies in brilliance, some being as intense as his sunlit garden views. In the Boudoir is, in fact, one of his more delicate interiors of the mid-1910s: soft pastel blues, lavenders, and yellows predominate, and a silvery white is pervasive. There exists a smaller, almost exact version of In the Boudoir painted in a stronger palette (see Related Work). Frieseke occasionally painted smaller versions of completed paintings he admired. It is not known if the smaller version of this composition is such a replica or a study for the larger painting.When the painting was exhibited at the Anglo-American Exposition in London in 1914, it was praised for its subtlety and found more satisfactory than Frieseke\u2019s other exhibit, The Garden Umbrella, n.d. (Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences, Savannah, Ga.). According to a letter from the New York dealer Robert Macbeth to Frieseke, In the Boudoir was bought out of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, where it won the grand prize. Mr. and Mrs. Baich, the collectors who donated the painting to the museum, began acquiring art in the mid-1910s and were known to purchase works from San Francsico dealers. Although it cannot be verified, it is quite plausible that the Balches may have bought In the Boudoir in 1915.",

      "curator notes" : "Evergood was moved by the violence and destruction of World War II to create a number of paintings on the theme of war. His concern did not end with the Allied victory. In July 1946 he wrote to Herman Baron of the A.C.A. Gallery, \"What with the Bikini fiasco and OPA [Office of Price Administration] this has been a pretty unsteading [sic] week\" (Archiv. Am. Art, American Contemporary Artists Gallery Papers, microfilm roll D304, ft 58). During 1946 and 1947 he created images such as New Death, 1947 (Terry Dintenfass, New York), which conveyed his anxiety about the new atomic age. Everybody Wants to Live, probably painted in the winter of 1946-47, demonstrates his skepticism over the ability of the victors to ensure a safe world.He depicted a narrow city street, typical of the area where he lived in lower Manhattan. During 1946 the house in which he lived was the scene of a murder and drug dealings, events that heightened his general state of anxiety. In the painting the pedestrians\u2019 attention is drawn toward the fantastic objects floating in the sky. The image of a sky chaotically filled with strange objects or birds was typical of Evergood\u2019s postwar paintings. The appearance of the colorful, striped flying machines at first seems innocent enough; their shape, however, recalls the airships that crowded the skies of Europe during the war. The other floating objects resemble underwater mines. The onlookers\u2019 expressions range from wonder and excitement to apprehension, suggesting that the ordinary citizen did not fully comprehend the ramifications of these war machines. Another ominous note to this bizarre scene is the sinister presence of the fat twins in the foreground, whose hats and cloaks may be military uniforms.Evergood realized the expressive potential of color and manipulated it to the fullest in this painting, presenting the flying objects in cheerful hues while the overall image is pervaded by a monochromatic gray. Not only does that color have a negative connotation, it is also the color of airplanes and other machines of war. Much of the scene is suffused by a soft haze, which may have been meant to be radioactive dust, for it appears in some of his other antiatomic images. Evergood was in Santa Fe when an atomic bomb was tested and recorded how he \"was sickened physically and mentally by these preparations for human destruction\" (Kendall F. Taylor, \"Philip Evergood and the Humanist Tradition,\" Ph.D. diss., Syracuse University, 1979, p. 106).The title Everybody Wants to Live is a plea for the future of mankind, but even this plea has its ironic twist. Evergood may have originally entitled the painting less positively, for \"nobody wants to die\" was written on the back of the canvas and then covered over with white paint.",

      "label" : "On July 2, 1946, the day after the United States exploded an atomic test-bomb on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, Evergood wrote to his New York dealer about how unsettling life had become. Subsequently he created a series of paintings expressing the anxieties of the atomic age. In Everybody Wants to Live, politics and personal events combine to form a nightmarish street scene. The setting is Greenwich Village, in lower Manhattan, where Evergood lived. During 1946, Evergood\u2019s brownstone dwelling was the scene of drug dealing and murder; thus the street locale he depicts is not a hospitable place. The pedestrians are entranced by fantastic flying objects, which, despite their pastel colors and striped decorations, suggest wartime dirigibles and underwater mines. In many of Evergood\u2019s paintings his hues verge on the garish, but here a monochromatic gray dominates. Much of the scene is suffused by a soft haze, which may represent radioactive fallout, for it appears in several of the artist\u2019s anti-bomb paintings. The paired figures in the foreground appear terrified. Evergood had painted Twin Celebrities, a portrait of the twin Jewish social-realist painters Raphael and Moses Soyer, several years before. In this postwar painting the twin reference may thus allude to the fate of the Jewish people. By changing the title of this work from the original Nobody Wants to Die \u2013 written on the back of the canvas and then painted over \u2013 to the more positive Everybody Wants to Live, Evergood made a plea for all mankind.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Wendt\u2019s earliest work appears to have been in the poetic tonalist style of the Chicago painters of the period that had evolved toward a form of impressionism, but throughout his career Wendt retained a sensitivity to the spiritual and poetic aspects of nature, as shown in his choice of motifs and titles.He was particularly attracted to the appearance of the hills in springtime, when the seasonal rains bring a lush greenness to the grass and live oaks, as in this painting. Its unusually strong greens and deep shadows combine to make it one of Wendt\u2019s most lyrical and tender works, notwithstanding its large size and vigorous, choppy brushwork. The high horizon and even, overall pattern of light and shade contribute to the decorative quality often found in Wendt\u2019s variety of impressionism.The Mantle of Spring was an early acquisition of the museum, the first work of art given to any institution by the Los Angeles District Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs, who presented it in \"grateful tribute to the Boys of America who gave their lives and the Mothers who gave their Sons in the World War.\" It was one example of the numerous cases nationwide of art patronage resulting from the First World War.",

Trained at the Art Institute of Chicago, Wendt began visiting California in 1894 and fell in love with the region. In 1906 he and his wife, sculptor Julia Bracken, settled in Los Angeles. There he promoted the French impressionist idea of painting outdoors in full sunlight (en plein air) and became California\u2019s premier impressionist painter. This canvas is early enough that his characteristic mature palette of bright green and yellow ochre is not quite established: green alone dominates, suggesting the new growth of springtime. Wendt applied his pigment with a straight-edge brush; his brushstrokes are blocky and assertive, more akin to those of postimpressionist painters such as Paul Cezanne than impressionist ones. Paintings such as this one helped boosters and real estate developers promote California as a new Garden of Eden in the early part of the century. However, Wendt, more than any other Southern California landscape painter, conveyed a personal love and respect for the region\u2019s untouched nature.

      "curator notes" : "Eilshemius\u2019s early paintings were almost all landscapes. These were unlike the personal style with which he later became identified but were typical of the period. As did many late nineteenth-century artists, Eilshemius fell under the influence of GEORGE INNESS and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796-1875) and produced paintings that could be considered to be in the Barbizon manner. Stormy Landscape reflects Inness\u2019s concern for weather conditions, specifically his love for approaching storms, as well as his colorful, poetic palette. Eilshemius painted the clouds in shades of pink, lavender, and gold to form a brilliant foil for the somber greens and blues of the foreground and distant trees. Eilshemius also constructed his composition as INNESS so often did by composing it around an expansive, open field in a settled area of the countryside. While Eilshemius captured the dramatic poetry of INNESS, he avoided the hazy atmosphere of Inness\u2019s late paintings.Small figures in peasant dress often appear in paintings of the Barbizon school. Here the woman seems to be wearing simple rustic clothes and wood shoes. The relatively large scale of the figure is more in keeping with those in the paintings of Corot than of Inness, except in the latter\u2019s work of the mid-1880s. While the painting reads as a landscape rather than as a figure composition set outdoors, the figure is an essential element of the painting, forming a compositional counterpoint to the stream on the right and row of trees in the background. Moreover, the woman contributes to the unsettling mood by her disproportionate scale and mysterious activity.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "In his search for the grand and scenic, Keith ventured throughout northern California and beyond. Consequently his repertoire of epic imagery was not limited to the stark, perpendicular, granite walls of Yosemite but also included alpine views such as California Pines. The painting is believed to be a view of east central California showing the upper reaches of the Kern River, which flows south from Mount Whitney towards Bakersfield in land that is now part of Sequoia National Park and the Dome Land wilderness. Alpine paintings by artists trained in Düsseldorf served as models for Keith\u2019s panoramic images with snow-capped mountains towering majestically in the background. He presented the California view in a traditional composition with the trees and sloping hills as repoussoir elements and a meandering river leading into the scene. His manner of presenting the hills is reminiscent of the treatment of the Rockies in the work of ALBERT BIERSTADT. While in the possession of the Vose Galleries, this landscape was shown throughout the country and eventually at the Biltmore Salon in Los Angeles, where it was purchased in 1929 for the museum. The painting was the first major acquisition funded by the museum\u2019s patron association.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In the 1920s Karfiol\u2019s art became more classical as he focused on standing nudes, odalisques, and females dressed in loose gowns of indefinite period. Along with his classicism went a modernist interest in color and form, which was inspired in part by Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). The woman in Seated Figure is fully modeled, as would be expected of an academically trained artist such as Karfiol, but her body has been simplified into solid geometric forms. She is placed in the center of the composition, sitting on a stool. The stool is actually too small and low to enable the woman, who is quite massive, to sit comfortably. She appears to be comfortable, however, because her pose gives the form of a pyramid, producing an effect of stability. She appears almost stonelike due to the monochromatic beige and white palette. Only by subtly varying the tones of pink, yellow, and brown for the flesh did Karfiol suggest that the figure was alive.When Seated Figure was exhibited in 1925-26 at the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings in Los Angeles, where it was awarded an honorable mention, it hung next to Parthenope by JOHN CARROLL (LACMA; q.v). The two paintings reflect the interest in classicism prevalent during the decade among artists who wished to synthesize figure painting and modernist abstract concerns. Karfiol\u2019s manipulation of the formal elements of his painting appears less extreme than does Carroll\u2019s. The art critic Antony Anderson noted that Seated Figure followed \"the Hellenic ideal in pose, arrangement of drapery, and in feeling.\"",

      "curator notes" : "California scenes by Hassam are not common; references suggest that there may not be more than a dozen. Hassam began traveling to the West Coast in the early years of this century, first to spend time with a patron in Oregon. Later he visited California several times. Hassam definitely visited the San Francisco area in 1914, to complete a lunette mural for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. While in San Francisco he stayed at the Bohemian Club but made excursions to the favorite painting spots of local artists in the neighboring areas, among them Carmel. Point Lobos, Carmel was the result of a sketching trip that Hassam took with the California landscape painter Francis J. McComas (1874-1938). McComas\u2019s second wife recounted to Kent Seavey the amusing story of how McComas became upset by Hassam when he insisted on turning his back upon a beautiful view of the coast to paint the scene from memory. Hassam\u2019s painting method may account for the similarities between this Carmel view and his coastal scenes of Maine. Carmel was a favorite painting locale for artists, but Hassam may have found it especially attractive because it reminded him of his beloved Appledore in New England. Northern California shares with Maine a rugged coastline, and Hassam seems to have approached both shores in similar terms. He focused on the weather-hewn boulders, constructing them with the same forceful, short, vertical and diagonal brushstrokes and rich, contrasting, dark and light hues that appear in his Maine paintings. Only the cypress, bent from the ceaseless pounding of the ocean winds, alludes to a western locale. When a group of Hassam\u2019s California landscapes was exhibited in the winter of 1915-16, they were considered \"striking\" and generally praised for their \"remarkable effects of filtered sunlight\" (American Art News 14 [December 4, 1915]: 5). Point Lobos, Carmel, however, describes a brilliantly sunny day.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery.

      "curator notes" : "Although Narjot is best known for his scenes of the Gold Rush and life in early California, he was also active as a portraitist, and several portraits of children in outdoor settings are known. The subject of this painting remains unidentified. Her dark hair and pierced ears suggest that the child was probably Hispanic, and her informal dress suggests this is a family portrait rather than a commissioned work. Her age and the painting\u2019s date preclude her being one of the artist\u2019s own daughters, however. Narjot often included a dog in his portraits of children.",

      "curator notes" : "Despite the title, Boy with a Cod is not one of Hansen\u2019s typical genre scenes of fishermen in which large figures dominated. The boy is small in scale and the cod not easily discernible. The painting is a seascape in which the figure of a boy merely serves to direct the viewer\u2019s gaze beyond the boats into the wide expanse of ocean and sky. Hansen was best known for his dramatic, stormy marines, but, as Boy with a Cod demonstrates, he was equally skilled in capturing the more delicate and serene aspects of nature. The soft, grayish tones of blue and green are characteristic of the palette he established early on, and such color symphonies enabled the artist to capture the atmospheric conditions and mood of the coast on a cold afternoon. His practice of posing the figure in the open air no doubt encouraged the direct, fresh brushwork.",

      "label" : "Dubbed the \u201cWinslow Homer of the West Coast\u201d for his powerful seascapes, Armin Hansen sometimes responded to the Monterey coastline in more delicate terms. Turn-of-the-century landscape and seascape paintings of northern California were dominated by a tonalist aesthetic, no doubt encouraged by the misty, luminous atmosphere that often pervades the region. Hansen moved to Monterey in the early 1910s after working on a trawler in the North Sea and painting in a colony of artists on the coast of Belgium. Consequently he was intimately versed in the moods of the sea. He devoted many of his paintings and prints to the fishing industry, often illustrating man\u2019s battle with the forces of the ocean. Boy with a Cod, on the other hand, depicts a young man on a solitary walk along the shore. The cold dampness of the sea and wetness of the air are hinted at by the direct brushwork and soft, cool palette. In this painting Hansen sensitively combined tonalism and impressionism to convey almost firsthand the boy\u2019s experience of nature.The painting was bought from an exhibition of works by San Francisco artists held at the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art in 1919. Its elaborately carved Arts and Crafts frame is original to the painting.",

      "curator notes" : "In the summer of 1916 Halpert returned to New York after several months in Spain and Portugal with Robert Delaunay (1885-1941) and his wife Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979). This view of the interior of the Toledo Cathedral was no doubt painted during that trip. Halpert had originally met Robert Delaunay years before in Brittany, and they remained friends even after Halpert\u2019s return to New York in 1911. Halpert acted as Delaunay\u2019s American representative during the dispute over the installation of Delaunay\u2019s City of Paris, 1910-12 (Musée national d\u2019Art moderne, Centre national d\u2019Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou, Paris) in the Armory Show.Toledo Cathedral was no doubt inspired by Robert Delaunay\u2019s series on Saint Severin painted in 1909. Both artists shared a fascination with color and light and expressed this interest through the motif of a church interior. Halpert, however, did not become as abstract in his work as did Delaunay, who manipulated the architecture of the Saint Severin church so that its structure became a series of prismatically colored planes in flux. Instead, Halpert used the solid Gothic architectural structure as a frame contrasted to the light and color filling the nave. The sunlight is softened as it enters through the stained glass windows and forms an almost tangible, hazy atmosphere in the church. Color and light constitute the subject of the painting, as the stained-glass windows cause patterns of alternating colors -- violet, yellow, orange, red, and green -- to flicker across the surfaces of the stone columns and floor.The museum\u2019s painting is very similar to another one of Toledo Cathedral done about the same time. The threestory elevation with clerestory depicted in the museum\u2019s version appears to be of the Gothic cathedral\u2019s transept near the crossing, while the other painting with its two-story elevation is of the nave. Although there are more stained glass windows in the cathedral\u2019s nave, both of Halpert\u2019s interpretations are equally concerned with light and color. The differences between the two versions are subtle. In the museum\u2019s painting Halpert positioned himself almost directly in front of the wall of glass and stone rather than on a slightly oblique angle as in the other version. Consequently the piers and arches appear less as a series of abstract, arcing lines and more as clearly defined archways. Both paintings have small figures, differing only in number and placement.According to photographs of the painting published when it was first exhibited in the autumn of 1916, the cathedral interior originally was shown with a plain stone floor. Sometime thereafter, for reasons unknown, Halpert changed the floor and some minor architectural details, such as the balustrade in the far-right triforium window.William Preston Harrison had wanted to purchase a major work by Halpert since 1916, the year of this painting. He was not able to obtain one until 1933, when he traded a dealer paintings by WALTER UFER, Grace Ravlin (born 1885), and WILLIAM WENDT for this painting.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "In April 1879 an exploration party of Mormons left the Cedar City-Fillmore area of Utah to scout out southeastern Utah before a group went to colonize the area. The larger party crossed Hole-in-the-Rock on their way to Bluff, where they eventually settled. Their passage was fraught with difficulties, not the least of which was the lowering of their wagons down the east slope of Hole-in-the-Rock, a process depicted in Westward.Buff had first become interested in the history of the Mormons in the late 1920s when he was asked to decorate the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Los Angeles. There he painted a series of lunettes depicting the original group of pioneering Mormons who moved West in 1847. For this and other commissions for smaller Mormon churches that he later received, Buff explored Nevada and Utah, travels which increased his admiration for members of the church.The subject of Westward fascinated Buff and he made several versions of it in oil as well as a lithograph. A photograph of Westward I in the transcript of the Buff interview in the Oral History Program, University of California, Los Angeles, and given the date 1933 is of a version similar to the museum\u2019s painting in overall conception, but it differs in details of the rock formation and the wagon train and in the placement of the signature. The next year he completed a large oil on canvas mural, Westward II (Santa Monica [Calif.] High School), for the Public Works of Art Project. In it the details of geography differ somewhat from those in the museum\u2019s painting and Buff added in the foreground a cliff on which a pioneer mother and two children perch precariously. In 1934, the same year he painted the mural Westward II he included in his solo exhibition at the Stendahl Art Galleries a painting titled Hurricane Pass on the Covered Wagon Trail in Southern Utah. Judging by its reproduction in the Los Angeles Times (July 22, 1934, pt. 2, p. 8) this appears to have been almost identical to the version now owned by the museum. Pentimenti in the museum\u2019s painting indicate that the placement of the small figures in the foreground was changed slightly. This suggests that the museum\u2019s version, which is undated, may have been first exhibited in 1934 as Hurricane Pass . . . and then changed slightly and given a new title. If so, the reason for the artist\u2019s alterations are not known.Buff\u2019s typical subject was the Western mountain landscape, its dramatic forms rendered as bold, clear shapes with an almost architectural quality. Its historical subject and rustic figures (one posed for by the artist\u2019s son) give Westward a more regionalist flavor. The genre element as well as the baroque viewpoint were typical of murals created in the 1930s.Westward displays the technique of the artist\u2019s earlier paintings: a thin underpainting of various colors applied in large areas of light and shade, each color enlivened by a series of short lines of a different and sometimes complementary color. The cliffs are maroon, orange, lavender, and beige; the distant hills are pastel blue, lavender, ocher, and green. The technique, which the artist described as \"pointillist,\" may recall Italian divisionist painting, which he might have known from his youth in Switzerland and southern Germany. Buff maintained this mature style until he gradually broadened it in later life.Although Buff was invited to exhibit paintings in his pointillist style with the city\u2019s modernists in the early 1920s, Westward won the first prize in the \"conservative class\" at the museum\u2019s Eighteenth Annual Exhibition: Painting and Sculpture, from which it was purchased. The Los Angeles art world had changed, but Buff had an individual style independent of the art movements around him.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "In the catalogue for the Vysekal memorial exhibition held at the Los Angeles Museum in 1940, Arthur Millier declared The Herwigs to be \"a landmark in the figure painting\" of Southern California. During his lifetime Vysekal became best known for multifigured compositions evidencing his early academic training. He had an excellent command of anatomy and depicted his characters brimming with life, their physiques healthy and robust. In The Herwigs he moved further from his training. Although Vysekal depicted fellow artist William K. Von Herwig (b. 1901) and his family, the figures were only a means to exercise his interest in color abstraction. This becomes more apparent when the unusual presentation of the figures is considered: the mother sits inside on a window seat playing with the child while the father looks on from outside, his hands pressed against the window. The figures form a contemporary Holy Family: the placement of the father outside the house accords with the not uncommon practice of depicting Saint Joseph slightly apart from the Virgin and Child. The family is encircled by the Hollywood Hills, which the artist has transformed into a bright background of color and light. The child\u2019s gesture of stretching upward leads the viewer\u2019s eye toward the prismatic glass wind chime, which recalls the coloristic and formal experiments of modernist artists.As early as 1916 Vysekal became fascinated by the abstract quality of color, and by 1921 this was reflected in the titles of many of his now lost paintings, such as Mlle R.: Arrangement in Green; Brickyard: Violet Major; and Arrangement: Scale of Orange. Color theories were popular among artists during the early twentieth century, and Vysekal may have been first introduced to them at the presentation of the Armory Show in Chicago. The art and teaching of STANTON MACDONALD-WRIGHT in Los Angeles during the 1920s no doubt encouraged Vysekal to apply color theory to his solidly rendered figure studies. In a warm palette of oranges and yellows Vysekal constructed the figures of the Herwigs with flickering planes of light and dark. While he did not completely relinquish modeling of the figure, he was more daring in his treatment of the background, abstracting the landscape into arcing color bands. Moreover, the use of a screen between the figures enabled him to play with the refraction of color and light. The brilliant light almost dissolves the forms while creating a halo effect. Arthur Millier described the glowing color as \"spiritualizing\" the painting\u2019s conception.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997When The Herwigs was first shown in an exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art, in 1928, it drew crowds of admirers as well as effusive praise from the press, suggesting that modern art had at last won acceptance in Los Angeles. A transplant from Chicago, Vysekal was an active member of several progressive art organizations in southern California during the post-World War I era. The Herwigs demonstrates his allegiance to Stanton Macdonald-Wright\u2019s revolutionary synchromist movement, with its application of the principles of music to color. Some of the subtitles of Vysekal\u2019s paintings \u2013 Arrangement in Green, Violet Major \u2013 show him organizing his compositions around specific color harmonies. In The Herwigs it is the \u201ckey\u201d or orange, which produces a strong luminous glow and suggests warmth and optimism.The painting portrays fellow artist William K. Von Herwig and his wife and child posed as the Holy Family, with the Hollywood Hills replacing Palestine as a backdrop. Despite such contemporary references the pyramidal composition of the portrait group is reminiscent of Raphael. Vysekal, like Macdonald-Wright, sought a fusion of modern ideas and universal truths.The frame is a beautiful example of Arts and Crafts hand carving, with cross-straps and other ornamentation limited to the corners.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Paul Rodman Mabury was born in San Jose, California, on December 17, 1869. He lived in California his entire life but did not make his residence in Los Angeles until about 1906. His father, who had helped establish the Security Pacific Bank of California, left him a considerable fortune, which he managed during his lifetime. He was himself a banker and president of H. & J. Marbury Company, a dried-fruit concern.Mabury was an anonymous contributor to several art organizations. He had long been an art lover and collector, and during the last 25 years of his life he assembled a collection of old masters and American art that was one of the finest in the city and of the greatest importance to the museum, which received it upon his death on January 10, 1939.William Preston Harrison wrote of him in the foreword to the catalogue of Mabury's collection: \"He had given his life, and his untiring efforts in that phase of culture he so loved- the collecting of rare art treasures. Art and great art alone was the essence of this existence and he never varied an inch or changed a moment from that goal, in order that someday the masses might share in that which had always been his own great source of pleasure and enrichment.\"The portrait's breadth, simplicity, and strength are characteristic of Johansen's mature style.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "Although little is known about this painting, it might have been created as a record of the accomplishment of modern horticulture. Such still lifes of specific agricultural products were common in the nineteenth century. Vernier\u2019s botanically accurate rendering of the pear skin, stem, and leaves, however, seems unusual in the context of the dramatic lighting, which was used by other American still-life painters of the period. According to the inscription on the back of the canvas, the large fruit was grown by Charles Nova in Los Angeles in 1864, but efforts to document a farmer with that name as then residing in Los Angeles have proved futile. The enormous weight of the pear--four pounds--must have caused quite a stir. California was perceived as a garden paradise, and the pear\u2019s size demonstrated the richness of the land. In the late 1870s, when the railroad linking the East and Southern California was completed, railroad companies issued posters extolling the fecundity of the land; one lithograph, depicting an array of fruit, referred to California as the \"cornucopia of the world.\"",

      "curator notes" : "Thomas Hill is so firmly identified with views of Yosemite that this painting was long thought to depict a lake in Yosemite even though no lake of this size is to be found there. The liberties that Hill took with topography make it difficult to identify conclusively the sites of a number of his paintings, but the distinctive double-peaked hill at the left, known as Maggies Peaks, mark this painting as a view of Lake Tahoe, and the waterfall suggests Emerald Bay. The Daily Alta California of June 19, 1864, in the year the museum\u2019s landscape was painted, mentioned that Hill exhibited a view of Emerald Bay of about the same size and also showing Maggies Peaks and the same sunset effect: \u2018A beautiful bit of Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe by T. Hill, was placed in the window of Jones, Woll [sic] and Sutherland. It is about 3\u2019 x 4\u2019, a sunset; the twin buttes (Maggies Peaks, at left) and snowy mountains in the distance are lit by the red rays of evening. The light and shade are forcible . . . .\" By the mid-1860s, tourists, such as those depicted in this painting, were visiting Emerald Bay.The museum\u2019s painting apparently is the earliest dated California landscape by Hill. The artist is so much identified with California views it is easy to forget that he came west as an accomplished landscape painter who had sketched in the White Mountains of New Hampshire with Benjamin Champney (1817-1907), Asher B. Durand (1796-1886), and GEORGE INNESS, among others identified with the Hudson River school. Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe is very much in the idiom of those artists.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

      "curator notes" : "The Spanish Stairs in Rome have been favored by tourists since they were constructed. The monumental double staircase with more than 130 steps was built in 1725 by the French on land owned by them. The stairs lead up a steep hill from a plaza to San Trinità dei Monti, which had been constructed earlier by Charles viii of France. Such throngs of people immediately flocked to see the stairs that guards from the nearby Spanish embassy were sent to keep order. While the French protested the Spanish intrusion onto their land, the Roman authorities ruled that the stairs fell under the jurisdiction of the Spanish. The public then began referring to the staircase as the Spanish Stairs. Hassam, painted the stairs during his trip to Europe in 1896-98, when he spent the month of January 1897 in Rome. As so many Americans before him, Hassam became entranced by this scenic spot in the Holy City, and he is known to have painted it at least three times. A comparison of this version with the one in the Newark Museum, of the same size, reveals a change in the artist\u2019s perception of the subject: in the museum\u2019s version Hassam viewed the staircase as a tourist image, presenting an expansive view of the stairs and church above while in the Newark version he moved closer to the scene, thereby eliminating the church and the full sweep of the grand staircase. In true impressionist fashion, Hassam may have used the motif of the Spanish Stairs to explore the effect of natural light during different times of the day. The Newark version has the brilliant color and intensity of a noonday sun, while the museum\u2019s painting has a more delicate, opalescent palette, suggesting the faint light at the onset of twilight. The hues subtly change from the warm orange of the light of the setting sun caught by the top of the church in the upper right corner of the painting to cooler tones of blue and lavender proceeding down the stairs. The indistinctness of the figures also suggests the crepuscular light of late afternoon. Hassam exhibited a painting titled Le Soir Piazza de Spagna (Rome) at the 1897 Salon of the Société National des Beaux Arts, and the museum\u2019s version, which has on its verso part of a French label dating from the 1890s, may be this evening scene.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Abril has always been interested in historic buildings and has often depicted them as contrasting with the newer structures in his native city. This painting was completed after he had finished a series of thirty-six paintings of the old buildings in the Bunker Hill area of downtown, 1959-63 (LACMNH).The Old Hall of Records was demolished in 1973 in the course of an urban renewal project. Designed by the firm of Hudson and Munsel, the building was erected in 1909 on Pound Cake Hill at Temple and Broadway streets. It remained in use until after the new Hall of Records was built across the street. In 1966, as part of his preparation for this painting, Abril photographed and drew sketches of the old building from the fifteenth floor of the recently completed Hall of Records. Such a close, yet high vantage point enabled him to delineate the massive, turreted old hall in all its dignity. Abril painted the canvas in his characteristically bright, contemporary version of the impressionist style.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "Although figures in landscapes are more common in Stuempfig\u2019s work than figures in interiors, this painting\u2019s imagery of loneliness and enigmatic suspense are central to his art.Stuempfig\u2019s themes and many of his formal devices are derived from surrealism and particularly from the variation of that movement most widely joined in the United Sates, magic realism. Like the work of this period by ANDREW WYETH, an artist living nearby in the Philadelphia area, Stuempfig\u2019s paintings appear to be realistic but depict the world of dreams and fantasy. The objective of both painters was to evoke in the viewer a certain mood from that realm. Stuempfig freely manipulated formal devices to undercut the seeming realism of his paintings, subtly suggesting a haunting strangeness. Strong frameworks of verticals and horizontals make the space in his paintings seem clear and organized, but large, central, empty spaces and conspicuously large separations between presumably related elements give the space a dreamlike quality. Strong effects of light and shadow, often from a raking light, enhance the impression of realism by bringing out the texture of surfaces, but the overly strong contrast of light and shadow in the modeling of the figures, recalling the early baroque period, injects a note of drama and menace.In this painting the extreme contrast in the modeling of the figure is particularly puzzling because the direct light from the window is shown to be striking the wall. A further quality of disquietude and unreality comes from the difficulty the viewer experiences in seeking to identify the subject of Stuempfig\u2019s paintings. Almost always there are figures, typically tough, adolescent males, who stand about idly, lost in their own troubling thoughts, without a relationship of position or action to any other figure or object in the painting. In the museum\u2019s painting this sense of thematic ambiguity is heightened by the familiar surrealist device of the juxtaposition of two conceivably related objects. The viewer must wonder about the relationship between the youth and the empty birdcage resting on an upturned music stand in this painting just as one wonders about the relationship between the similarly posed young man and the isolated houses in Stuempfig\u2019s painting, Two Houses, c. 1940s (Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The stiles of the antique chair, behind which the boy stands, establish a visual metaphor for the bars of the birdcage, perhaps hinting at the youth\u2019s spiritual captivity.The settings of most of Stuempfig\u2019s paintings are entirely imaginary or greatly transformed, but the titles of a certain number of them acknowledge that he has painted his studio, as he may have done in the present case. The same chair and a similarly spare interior are seen in his painting Solitary Figure, 1948 (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco). The same model may be portrayed in Stuempfig\u2019s painting Portrait of Charles, 1949 (art market, 1974).",

In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",
      "curator notes" : "Hugh Montgomerie was born in 1739, the son of Alexander Montgomerie of Coilsfield, Ayrshire, Scotland. He entered the army in 1756 and was a lieutenant when the Seventy-seventh Regiment, or Montgomerie\u2019s Highlanders, was raised and commissioned by his kinsman Archibald Montgomerie (later eleventh earl of Eglinton). The regiment saw action in the French and Indian War at Fort Duquesne, Ticonderoga, and other places and in 1760 and 1761 against the Cherokees, defeating them in battles at Etchocy and War-Women\u2019s Creek. Hugh Montgomerie had risen to the rank of major by 1780, when Copley painted his portrait, and had been elected member of Parliament for Ayrshire. He succeeded to the title of twelfth earl of Eglinton in 1796. In 1780 Montgomerie\u2019s bright political career yet lay before him. He was still active in the army, rising to the rank of colonel in 1793, so it would have been natural for him to have himself portrayed as a soldier. The decision to paint him leading a battle fought twenty years earlier probably was the artist\u2019s. The portrait belongs to the tradition of grand-manner portraiture, as promulgated by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), president of the Royal Academy. The concept was to raise the artistic value of a portrait by ennobling mere representation with elements of higher art. Copley\u2019s portrait meets these objectives by incorporating elements of history painting, considered to be the highest genre. It has a color and drama not to be found in simple portraiture, depicting the subject as a man of energy and importance. Another elevating feature, which serves to further flatter the subject, results from Copley\u2019s decision to follow Reynolds\u2019s example by posing Montgomerie in the striding stance of the Apollo Belvedere (Vatican Museum, Rome), then considered the greatest ancient sculpture. Comparison with the museum\u2019s Portrait of a Lady shows how quickly after his arrival in England Copley had mastered the heightened palette and bravura technique of the best of the English school.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997This portrait of a Scottish officer who fought in the French and Indian Wars brilliantly evokes the internationalism of 18th-century British life and culture. Copley was already the foremost portraitist in the American colonies before he moved to England in 1775. He abandoned the New World for political reasons; however, the move enabled him to paint more elevated themes than the American portrait trade had afforded him. In London he demonstrated his virtuosity by abandoning his tight, linear brushwork for the greater bravura and flair of fashionable London portrait painters such as Sir Thomas Lawrence.Copley\u2019s depiction of Hugh Montgomerie also demonstrates the artist\u2019s success in the new field of contemporary history painting. Montgomerie served in the 77th Regiment of Highlanders, who fought at Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain and Fort Duquesne in present-day Pittsburgh. Copley presented Montgomerie on the heroic scale of grand-manner portraits and posed him after one of the most famous statues of antiquity, the Apollo Belvedere. The palette of deep greens, reds, and blacks and the threatening clouds enhance the drama of the gruesome scene in the lower left.",

      "curator notes" : "Little is known about Richard Barrington (died 1814 in Valenciennes), who became the fourth viscount Barrington in 1801. He married Susannah Budden (1761-1830) of Philadelphia, daughter of Captain William and Louisa Cuzzins Budden, in 1783. Although the Barrington family belonged to the peerage of Ireland, their principal residence was listed in 1783 as Becket House, Shrivenham, England. In 1785 Stuart painted a portrait in London of Richard Barrington\u2019s uncle, Admiral Samuel Barrington. It is possible that Captain William Budden\u2019s family moved to England after the Revolution. The subject was associated with London, Dublin, and Philadelphia, the cities where Stuart spent three of his most important periods, but the style of the painting appears to be that found in the portraits Stuart painted in New York immediately after his return to this country in 1793. As in those portraits, Barrington\u2019s figure is drawn as though immediately against the picture plane, a silhouette established from the indefinite background. The seriousness and direct gaze of the subjects of these portraits contribute to a feeling of sensitive realism, enhanced by skillfully differentiated textures.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Although most of Huntington\u2019s long career was taken up in painting more than one thousand portraits, he also painted landscapes and probably thought of himself as a painter of allegories and ideal subjects. His interest in religious and allegorical painting had been kindled by the Raphaelesque Italian and German ideal subjects he had seen in Rome on his first trip to Europe in 1839. By the 1860s his models were the Venetian artists of the High Renaissance, especially Titian (c. 1488-1576), whose example can be seen in the costumes and figure types depicted in Philosophy and Christian Art. The model or the type of the old man also appears in Huntington\u2019s Sowing the Word, 1868 (New-York Historical Society). The influence of the Venetian school can also be seen in the rounder forms and richer palette of his paintings of this period. Even the halflength format seems to echo Venetian examples. The model for the painting to which the young lady gestures, however, appears to be The Adoration of the Shepherds, 1650, by José Ribera (1588-1652) in the Louvre, Paris.The painting is conceived as a conversation between embodiments of opposing, but equally worthy points of view. The wisdom of the aged scholar, reading a book by lamplight, is contrasted with the intuitive perceptions of the young woman who examines a work of art by the daylight signified by the window. Huntington has cast in terms of ideal figures one of the pressing problems of his own times, when scientific findings seemed to challenge the truth and wisdom of religion conveyed by artistic and other nonscientific forms of perception.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Sargent began to receive commissions as a result of the success of his portrait of Carolus-Duran presented at the Paris Salon of 1879. The first of the Paris elite to patronize him was the playwright Edouard Pailleron. So pleased was Pailleron with his portrait that he asked Sargent to paint his wife at the country estate of Mme Pailleron\u2019s father, Edmund Buloz, editor of the influential La Revue des deux mondes. In August 1879 Sargent spent six enjoyable weeks at Ronjoux, the Buloz summer home in Savoy, in southeastern France. Before leaving, he painted a portrait of his hostess, Mme Buloz, as a gift for her. Mme Buloz (née Christine Blaze de Bury) later professed to her sister that she did not care for the portrait, \"I do not find it flattering enough; it is as I will look in ten years time if God allows me to live that long!\" Despite Mme Buloz\u2019s objections, the portrait Sargent created clearly demonstrates his ability to capture a sitter\u2019s character. He presented Mme Buloz, an elderly woman, in a direct, frontal pose. As she quietly looks out at the viewer, her forthright but gentle gaze suggests a perceptive personality. Sargent\u2019s brushwork is spontaneous; with a deft hand and few strokes he sensitively modeled her expressive face. In such portrait sketches Sargent often conveyed greater vitality and freshness than in his more finished, commissioned works. Although Mme Buloz wears black and emerges from a shadowy interior, the portrait is rich, demonstrating that at this early stage Sargent was already a master of the restricted palette that his teacher had extolled.",

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville.

The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad.

      "curator notes" : "Although he painted many portraits of men, Baker was most highly regarded for portraits of women and children. This portrait, painted while he was strongly influenced by romanticism, displays the idealization, soft brushwork, and rich color for which Baker was known. Like other artists of the period, he has used the soap bubble to represent the innocent pleasures of childhood but also the transience of youth. Even though the subject required an outdoor setting, Baker introduced a column and curtain on the left as an element of formality. The identification of the sitters can only be conjectured. The large size of the painting, the number of figures, and the attire all suggest that the portrait was commissioned by someone from the upper middle class, perhaps a prosperous businessman or financier. In 1854, the year after the portrait was painted, Baker exhibited in the National Academy of Design annual a group portrait of children owned by E. B. Sutton. Effingham B. Sutton (1817-1891) was the founder of the Sutton Line, the first clipper shipping service from New York to San Francisco. As Sutton fathered fourteen children, the museum\u2019s portrait may be of his three oldest sons and daughter.",

      "curator notes" : "After the Hunt, Neal\u2019s first great success, was a transitional work between his early architectural paintings and the history paintings that were to win him renown. Although not a history painting, it demonstrates his total mastery of the technique that would make those paintings so successful. Produced while Neal worked in Piloty\u2019s atelier, After the Hunt exemplifies the style of romantic realism practiced and taught by his professor. During the late 1860s Piloty had transformed the teaching of the Munich academy by introducing an emphasis on skillful painting technique. Although based on the work of the old masters, the style he taught was capable of impressive realism of lighting and textures. It also reflected painstaking research of authentic settings, costumes, and accessories. After the Hunt, with its baroque lighting, dramatic contrasts, and rich, warm tonality, strikes the note of romanticism central to the style. The aristocratic hunter and the servant girl dressed in period costume, nominally the subject of the painting, are secondary to the foreground still-life arrangement, in which Neal\u2019s virtuosity has persuasively reproduced a wide range of textures.Still-life compositions are rare in the Munich tradition in contrast to that of Vienna, where this type--the corner of a room with a table piled with bric-a-brac -- was known. Two other Americans, WILLIAM M. CHASE and Theodore Wores (18601939), also included background figures in the most important still life they produced during their student years in Munich.Neal\u2019s painting originally bore the title Retour de Chasse and was reproduced in Aldine in 1872 as After the Chase.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Although not known for them, Speicher seems to have painted landscapes throughout his career, exhibiting them with his figure paintings. After the late 1930s he increasingly concentrated on the landscape. His landscapes are more modernist than his figure paintings and reveal the impact of Paul Cézanne (1839-1906). No doubt because of his affiliation with the Woodstock colony, most are of sites in upstate New York. Landscape was painted at Rondout Basin, near Kingston, New York, a small town along the Hudson River north of New York City.This painting probably dates from the 1920s, perhaps the later part of the decade, as indicated by the similarity of its brushwork to that in dated landscapes from that period or later. A dating to the 1920s would coincide with the period when George Bellows, a close friend of Speicher\u2019s, was working at Woodstock, which also may explain the vigor of the brushwork. The warehouse and ramshackle buildings are presented as simplified geometric forms built up with short, heavy, staccato brushstrokes of opaque paint. While the overall palette is somber to convey the drabness of the town\u2019s riverfront, it is enlivened with passages of warm rose and orange hues. Speicher retained some of Henri\u2019s and Bellows\u2019s rich color sense in his use of lavender, pink, and blue in the cloudy, gray sky.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "A powerful image of an old peasant woman resigned to her approaching death, this painting may be Page\u2019s masterpiece. The stark chiaroscuro and almost monochromatic palette of deathly blacks, browns, and grays convey the woman\u2019s condition. Her drawn and wrinkled face is propped up against a large pillow, which forms a halo around her face. With her hands tightly folded, she turns toward the right where a small glass of violets, symbols of death, rests on a bare wood table. In this vividly realist work Page displays a thorough knowledge of the human figure, based no doubt on his academic training. This painting may have been exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1889 as La Grand-mère. A critic in the American Register noted Page\u2019s strongly drawn and expressive figure. Another critic may have been considering Page\u2019s painting when he deplored the large number of \"funer[e]al, dolorious, or elegiac subjects\" in the exhibition (Theodore Child, \"The Paris Salon of 1889,\" Art Amateur 21 [June 1889]: 7). George W. Lininger, who owned the painting in the early years of this century, had a large collection of old-master and nineteenth-century European and, to a far lesser extent, American paintings, sculptures, and objets d\u2019art. He opened a gallery for his collection in Omaha in 1888 and permitted the public to visit twice weekly.",

      "curator notes" : "The stylistic source for the clarity and sculptural presence of Roesen\u2019s fruit still-life compositions easily can be traced to artists in his north German background, but little there anticipates the exuberant energy of his mature American style. Fruit Still Life in a Landscape was commissioned by Mrs. Alma White of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Its provenance and similarity to the large painting of fruit, n.d., in the collection of the Lycoming Hotel, Williamsport, firmly date the museum\u2019s painting to the period the artist lived in Williamsport. Few of his fruit pieces from the 1860s are dated, and his mature style, once established, did not change much in his fruit still-life compositions until very late. The presence of a landscape background in the Fruit Still Life with Wine Glass and Coins in a Landscape, dated 1861 (private collection), suggests a date in the early 1860s for the museum\u2019s painting, but a painting with a more similar landscape background bears the date of 1867 (Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas). A still life of flowers with a landscape background (private collection) bears the date of 1850, but it appears that Roesen used such backgrounds more often during the 1860s. The landscape in the museum\u2019s painting is an unusual feature that adds a dramatic note. Roesen\u2019s adoption of landscape backgrounds is thought to reflect the taste, inspired by the English Pre-Raphaelites, for still-life compositions in a natural setting. Roesen\u2019s response is a somewhat artificial compromise, in which he set his conventional tabletop still life in front of a landscape, with little connection between the two. His landscape compositions almost always conform to the formula of trees and road on the left, clouded sky and distant hills on the right. Numerous other aspects of the museum\u2019s painting also employ formulas familiar in Roesen\u2019s work, for instance, the corner of a gold-fringed pillow emerging from a fold in a large cloth. Roesen\u2019s central theme is that of abundant fruitfulness. The composition is so crowded that it appears as though a great cornucopia is spilling fruit from one tier to the other and out into the viewer\u2019s space. Roesen uses the trompe l\u2019oeil device of having fruits and leaves overhang the edges of the table, but this confuses the sense of space within the painting; the predominant appearance is that of a single wall of fruit, which enhances the painting\u2019s decorative character. The color in the museum\u2019s painting is exceptionally strong for the artist. The primary colors are announced in the group of lemon peel, cherries, and blue plum on the lower shelf. Elsewhere the colors are more mixed, except in the brilliant red of the strawberries high on the footed milk-glass dish.",

      "curator notes" : "After his return to the United States in 1855, Hunt worked in Newport, Rhode Island, continuing to produce figure paintings reflecting the spell of Millet. Girl with Cows relates closely to the peasant images Hunt created while in France, in particular his On the Edge of the Forest, c. 1853 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), in which a woman stands next to a grazing cow in a forest glade. The image of a female peasant quietly involved in knitting or sewing, while tending farm animals, was a common theme in mid-century French art. Millet created several such images, including Peasant Woman Guarding Her Cow, 1852 (Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam), while Hunt lived at Barbizon. Edward Wheelwright, another follower of Millet in the intimate circle around Hunt, may have been instrumental in Hunt\u2019s creating this specific image. Wheelwright brought back to America Millet\u2019s The Knitter, 1856 (Cincinnati Art Museum), which is the closest pictorial source for Hunt\u2019s Girl with Cows. Unlike On the Edge of the Forest but similar to Millet\u2019s The Knitter, Girl with Cows depicts a young peasant girl in a secluded forest glade with the thick foliage of trees forming a barrier between her and the distant field seen partially in the distance. Consequently the focus is solely on the figure and cows. The scene is painted in dark, shadowy tones. Two cows--one brown, the other white--frame the young girl, forming contrasts of light and dark, while picking up the sweet pink and blue colors of her simple peasant garb. The white handkerchief wrapped around her head glows in the reflected yellows and pinks. Indeed, the entire scene is rich with color, even to the warm browns and greens of the darker passages.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997William Morris Hunt was a major proselytizer of French Barbizon painting and was almost solely responsible for introducing that style to the United States. Hunt trained with Thomas Couture in Paris during the late 1840s and worked with the peasant painter Jean-Francois Millet in the forest of Barbizon, thus was fully accomplished in mid-century French romantic aesthetics. Although he became a prominent portrait painter in New England after his return to the United States in 1855, he also produced landscapes and peasant scenes. Girl with Cows amply demonstrates Hunt\u2019s adoption of Barbizon subject matter and style: this quiet, naturalistic rendering of a peasant woman knitting among her cows is conveyed in deep, glowing tones that heighten the nostalgia of the theme. Peasant life was quickly dying out in France and other areas of western Europe, as industrialization transformed agricultural production and beckoned young laborers to the cities.The fluted cove (concave) frame became popular after the Civil War as artists and artisans, striving for restraint, based their designs on eighteenth-century French neoclassical examples. This frame, dating from the late 1860s, may be the original one, as Hunt was such a major proponent of French art and style.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Recessional was Savage\u2019s most critically acclaimed easel painting from the 1920s. He painted two almost identical versions, both dated 1923. He exhibited these canvases simultaneously throughout the country at annual art exhibitions from 1923 to 1925. The other version (Mattatuck Museum, Waterbury, Connecticut) was awarded prizes when it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago, while the museum\u2019s painting was awarded the John Schaffer Prize at the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings at the museum in 1925-26.Although the smaller of the two, the museum\u2019s painting is probably not a study in view of its large scale and complete finish. It may have been the first version, since in it basic changes to the composition are discernible: areas of a more opaque overpainting cover alterations, most notably a change in direction of the scales. The Italianate architectural frame is original and typical of Savage\u2019s presentation of his early easel paintings as early Renaissance altarpieces. The frame and painting technique reflect Savage\u2019s attempt to echo the early Renaissance masters he had studied in Italy.Desiring his painting to appear as an old master fresco, Savage prepared the canvas surface with a thick layer of gesso, roughened the overall surface, and then sculpted many of the details before beginning to paint. The oil paint was applied in thin, transparent layers, which were wiped and set with a fixative, further creating the illusion of a frescoed surface.Although the size and format suggest that Savage intended the painting to resemble an altarpiece, the subject is a modern allegory inspired by World War I. The artist employed the religious imagery of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as the central motif to symbolize the war\u2019s destruction. A bulletin that was issued at the time the Los Angeles Art Association purchased the painting provides a detailed analysis of the imagery: the Four Horsemen trampling the world into ruins signify not only the tragedy of war in general but the recurring cycle of war, conquest, plague, and death. The older figure of the crowned archer is Greed, who releases his shaft of envy and hate toward the far horizon, while War, bearing a sword, is joined by Pestilence with his scales and Death with his scythe. A wounded man in uniform lies dying in the foreground. Remnants of the civilization that was destroyed by the war are scattered throughout. The large rose window of a cathedral forms a center backdrop and refers to the church, the support of humanity through the ages. For Savage the church imagery refers to the literary source of the painting\u2019s theme and title: Rudyard Kipling\u2019s famous poem \"Recessional\" (1897). Kipling believed that throughout the course of history God alone was immutable. On the left, sheltered by a stone arch, an idealized female nude symbolizing Bereavement and Truth holds an infant who symbolizes the hope of Regeneration. At her feet are scattered a number of books, the largest of which is a Bible open to the Beatitudes.The two versions of Recessional differ only in minor details: in the museum\u2019s version the infant has hair falling over her left eye (perhaps symbolically obstructing her view of the future), fewer books are piled up in the lower left, and the stonework of the wall in the background is different.The painting was acquired through public subscription; over two hundred subscribers, including socially prominent figures and artists organizations, contributed through the Los Angles Art Association. Among them were the critic Arthur Millier and painters Carl Oscar Borg, Paul Sample, and HANSON PUTHUFF. Such diverse support reveals both Savage\u2019s stature during the thirties and the continued appetite for war memorials following the first World War.",

      "curator notes" : "Still-life paintings are rare in Duncanson\u2019s oeuvre. Seven canvases are known today. The decorations Duncanson created from 1848 to 1850 for Belmont, the home of his patron Nicholas Longworth (now the Taft Museum, Cincinnati), may have stimulated his interest in such subject matter. Although painted in a different, more rococo style, the decorative panels included two overdoor designs of fruit and flowers in vases. Longworth was not only a lawyer and a major patron of the arts but one of the finest horticulturists in America. He played a major role in the commercialization of grapes and cultivation of strawberries. However, in none of Duncanson\u2019s located still, lifes did the artist focus on grapes. Rather, in the fashion of most still-life specialists, he included a variety of food: apples, grapes, oranges, raisins, nuts, pineapples, and honeycombs. The last two items were considered exotic and often were included in Victorian still lifes; in the South the pineapple was a symbol of hospitality. Still Life is a transitional piece, exhibiting characteristics typical of both early- and midnineteenth-century American still-life paintings, due in part to the date of the painting and to the fact that it was painted in a frontier environment, which slightly lagged behind the East in artistic developments. In the tradition of paintings by the Peale family, the fruit and nuts are arranged on a bare, wood table with a dark background and strong lighting. Duncanson\u2019s composition is more elaborate than the spare, neoclassical arrangements of Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825) and closer to those by James Peale (1749-1831) and younger Peale children. In fact, Sarah Miriam Peale (1800-1885) extended the Peale influence to the West when she moved to Saint Louis in 1847. The arched format was a later, more Victorian element, however, used by SEVERIN ROESEN and many other artists of the 1850s and 1860s. Two other Duncanson still-life paintings (Detroit Institute of Arts and Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) have similar compositional treatments and formats. However, in these two, following mid-century fashion, the still-life elements are set on a white tablecloth rather than a bare wooden table. In complexity of arrangement, the museum\u2019s still life seems to be midway between the Corcoran Gallery picture, the least complex, and that in the Detroit Institute, the most complex. Duncanson exhibited his fruit still-life paintings at state fairs and art displays in Detroit, Cincinnati, and New York during the late 1840s and 1850s. While not all the exhibits can be definitely identified with known works, it is probable that the museum\u2019s still life was shown at one time, possibly at the Western Art Union or Detroit Gallery of Fine Arts in Fireman\u2019s Hall.",

      "curator notes" : "The letter that the male sitter has apparently just pulled from his correspondence folder is addressed to [Ja]cob Gerard Koch (1761-1830), a prosperous merchant and prominent citizen of Philadelphia. Born in Holland, Koch emigrated to America before 1778. His business as an importer and merchant of \"German\" linens made him wealthy enough to purchase a country estate, Fountain Green, at the Falls of the Schuylkill in about 1801 and leave an immense estate in 1830 of more than a million dollars. A conspicuous patriot during the War of 1812, he contributed five thousand dollars toward the building of a frigate. Contemporaries remarked upon his exceptional corpulence; he weighed more than three hundred pounds. The letter bears a postal hand stamp \"SHIP\" and a manuscript rate marking \"6.\" Although the six-cent rate was in use for a long time (1794-1861), the earliest known use of the \"SHIP\" hand stamp was in 1817, which suggests to historian Frederick S. Dickson that the paintings should be dated between 1817 and 1820, when Koch retired from business and moved to Paris. At that time he was married to his second wife, Jane Griffith (born in Ireland about 1772), whom he had married in Philadelphia in 1801. She survived her husband and lived in Paris until 1848. In 1833 Mrs. Koch wrote to her brother-in-law Matthew Huizinga Messchert in Philadelphia to order a copy of the portraits from THOMAS SULLY, who referred to them in his journal as by \"R. Peale,\" confirming the stylistic evidence that points to an attribution of the original portraits to Rembrandt Peale. Closely comparable with the Koch portrait, for instance, would be Rembrandt Peale\u2019s portrait of General Samuel Smith from the period of about 1817-18, in Baltimore\u2019s Peale Museum, and his portrait of Isaac McKim of the same period at the Maryland Historical Society. Peale frequently posed his male subjects with one arm over a chair back to create a pyramidal composition, as in the portrait of Koch. Together with a general simplification and geometrizing of form, this most stable of compositions contributes to the neoclassical order of the portrait, which, however, is balanced by the strong contrasts and turbulent sky painted in the romantic tradition. As was his custom, Peale carried out the wife\u2019s portrait in an even more romantic manner, with flowing lines, softer modeling, and a less direct gaze. While the male and female types are dissimilar, the unified architectural space between the portraits leaves little doubt that they are a pair. This background is among the most elaborate and impressive that Rembrandt Peale painted. Together with the richness and high quality of the figure painting, it marks the pair as among the artist\u2019s finest works.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",
      "curator notes" : "In June 1729 Smibert painted a portrait of then-Major Paul Mascarene, his seventh American sitter. The painting recalls his English, period portrait of Lieutenant General Charles Otway, 1724 (Royal Sussex Regiment, Chichester) in its use of the convention of half armor for a military commander. The armor is at least a century earlier in its design, which presumably was taken from Smibert\u2019s treasury of drawings and engravings. The armor, a highly unusual feature in Boston portraiture, with its virtuoso highlights and reflections, was a showpiece of Smibert\u2019s abilities and could not fail to catch the eye of the poetizing Mather Byles, who mentioned it in the line, \"and studious Mascarene asserts his arms.\" The portrait also contains a landscape background and a small still life of a map and drafting instruments. The still life refers to Mascarene\u2019s coastal survey of Nova Scotia, which could have served as the basis for the fortified harbor seen in the portrait. Smibert was one of the few early colonial artists who sometimes painted specific, actual landscapes as backgrounds in his portraits. Whether it depicts an actual or proposed fortification, it apparently is not Annapolis Royal, the location with which Mascarene is chiefly associated and for which he attempted to improve the fortifications. Paul Mascarene was born Jean-Paul Mascarene in France in 1684 or 1685 of a family of Huguenots later forced to leave the country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. He was educated in Geneva and in 1706 began a military career in England. In 1708 he was in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, preparing troops for an expedition against Canada, and in 1710 he was the captain who took possession of Port Royal (renamed Annapolis Royal) in the campaign that won Nova Scotia for Britain. He was thereafter very involved in the military life and civil government of the province, although he spent much time in Boston, where he married Elizabeth Perry, built a large brick house, and raised a family. He was known as a man of considerable learning and taste. In a letter of 1740 he referred to \"four large pictures of Mr. Smibert\" in his possession. Between, 1740 and 1749 he was chief administrator of Nova Scotia during the campaign against Louisbourg. He became a major general in 1758 and died in Boston in 1760.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997John Smibert was the first fully trained painter to settle in the colonies. A Scotsman, he studied in London with the painter Sir Godfrey Kneller and pursued a career as a portraitist in Edinburgh and London before sailing for the British colony of Bermuda in 1728, where he intended to become a professor of art. While on a stopover, he became enamored of Boston and decided to settle there. Technically superior to any other artist in the colonies at the time, Smibert achieved great success.This virtuosic portrait of Paul Mascarene contrasts the highlights of the armor with the soft atmosphere of the landscape seen through the window. Although born in France of Huguenot parents, Mascarene was a captain in the British army and was involved in the campaign that won Nova Scotia for Britain. The map and instruments on the table refer to a surveying project he undertook in that province. The distant buildings may allude to his plans for a fortification of the area. The portrait was no doubt done in Boston while Mascarene was home visiting family.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Vedder did few still-life paintings and only four of Japanese objects. The collecting of oriental bric-a-brac became very popular in America among artists and the general public with the initiating of trade relations between Japan and the West by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and with the exhibition of many exotic objects at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Vedder was particularly fortunate as a collector; for his brother Alexander Madison Vedder was a physician practicing in Japan from 1865 to 1870, first privately and then as head of the Imperial Hospital at Kobe. Dr. Vedder was well aware of the beauty and exoticism of oriental items and purchased many objects. After Alexander\u2019s death in 1870, Vedder received three trunks containing his brother\u2019s effects, including his Japanese purchases. The objects in Vedder\u2019s Japanese still-life paintings may have been among them. This painting depicts nineteenth-century items: the golden heron screen in the style of the Kano school, a shiny, black Meijiperiod vase, an album of paintings with a bonsai on the left page, and a carpet probably of Japanese manufacture but with a Western-influenced design.Despite his awareness of the nature of Japanese aesthetics, and unlike his friend Charles Caryl Coleman, who used the Japanese aesthetic in his still lifes of this period, Vedder conceived his painting in traditional Western terms. The arrangement resembles the way in which Japanese items were displayed at the 1876 Centennial and pictured in various books commemorating the fair. The manner in which Vedder luxuriated in the voluminous folds of the rich drapery reveals his long-standing love of elegant textiles, seen more often in his single-figure paintings of the 1870s.During his lifetime Vedder exhibited still lifes that included oriental objects and were sometimes titled Japanese Still Life. It is possible that the museum\u2019s example was the one exhibited in Vedder\u2019s showings of 1880. However, since the painting was privately owned by then, it is unlikely that the museum\u2019s painting was the still life included in Vedder\u2019s 1900-1901 traveling exhibition or his exhibitions in New York and Boston in 1912.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Still lifes are rare in the work of Elihu Vedder, who is known for landscapes and imaginary figure paintings, book illustrations, and murals. Although he often infused his art with symbolic and personal meanings, this grouping of beautiful objects is more indicative of the taste of the time. When isolationist Japan signed a treaty with American commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1854, opening some of its ports to trade, Westerners became fascinated by this long-hidden culture. By the late nineteenth century the collecting of Japanese objects had become a passionate hobby for some Americans. Vedder\u2019s still life includes items that were probably left to him by his brother Alexander, who acquired them during the late 1860s while practicing medicine in Japan. This arrangement employs traditional Western perspective rather than asymmetrical composition of Japanese prints and paintings. He arranged the folding screen, black Meiji-period vase, album of paintings, seashell, and carpet in a manner analogous to the displays of objects in store windows and at fairs such as the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial. Vedder\u2019s still life epitomizes the enthusiasm for Asian material culture as a commodity that wealthy Westerners could acquire. This frame is from the late 1870s or 1880s. The flat center band of oak has gold leaf applied directly to the wood, without the traditional intermediary gesso layer. This treatment, which retains the patterning of the grain, was first advocated by the English pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and later adopted by James A. M. Whistler. It became popular in America beginning in the 1890s.",

      "curator notes" : "Since Blakelock rarely dated any of his mature works, it is impossible to precisely date his paintings. Landscape with Trees can, at least, be dated to the period of about 1883 to 1898, a time when the artist was working in his best known style, employing silhouettes and lacy foliage effects. Particularly visible in the sky is the deliberately textured heavy paint surface that Blakelock liked to paint on with his generally thin paint and glazes. The compositional grouping of trees around a central vista is a familiar one in his work. The landscape is peppered with flickering highlights, as the light from the overcast sky seems to partially dissolve the foliage\u2019s tracery. The mood is that of an airless stillness and solitude, a visionary landscape of the spirit rather than of a particular place and time. More than many, which have greatly darkened over time, this evocative painting reveals Blakelock\u2019s sensitivity to delicate color, which is employed with an almost musical sense of abstract design.",

      "curator notes" : "Matulka painted landscapes throughout his career; he interpreted them in a modernist idiom less radical than that of his stilllife compositions. In 1921 he began summering regularly in Czechoslovakia and while there began his \"Village\" scenes. Although Autumn Landscape has an inscription on the stretcher dating it to 1926, the painting\u2019s style is more like that of his landscapes of 1921-23. The cubic structure of the houses suggests the influence of Cézanne and Picasso. The rich palette and exuberant brushwork reveal the impact of more contemporary art. Matulka may have known of the art of Franz Marc (1880-1916), yet it is more likely that landscapes such as Autumn Landscape were informed by the post World War I School of Paris, in particular, artists such as Roger de la Fresnaye (1885-1925) who were active in Paris when Matulka lived in that city. The brilliant hues-clear yellows, oranges, and russets, and bold blues and greens-are more allied with the second generation cubists than with Picasso himself. Critics commented on the vibrance of Matulka\u2019s palette when this painting was exhibited in his first solo exhibition. Also seen in this and other landscapes shown in that 1927 exhibit is Matulka\u2019s overwhelming love of movement: not only did he often use the motif of a sweeping road to lead the viewer into his scenes, he also enlivened his surfaces with patches of flickering color that almost contradict the solidity of the forms.Although the brilliant autumnal colors might suggest a New England locale, an area in which Matulka is known to have summered during the mid-1920s, the site may have been in France or Czechoslovakia. A partially erased inscription on the frame indicates Provence as the locale. For Matulka landscapes were personal reminiscences of places he knew intimately.",

      "curator notes" : "Stewart\u2019s paintings of the elegant and fashionable world in which he lived were sometimes inspired by specific events and often included his friends. In The Baptism he depicted with a studied realism an elaborate interior and the costume of members of high society gathered to witness the baptism of one of their own. The realistic details suggest that the figures were portraits of specific persons. In Stewart\u2019s earlier painting The Hunt Ball, a key was provided to identify many of the figures. No key is known to exist for The Baptism. The painting has been traditionally considered to be of the Vanderbilts, but all attempts to substantiate this have proved fruitless. Although most of the male figures have distinctive physiognomies, Stewart\u2019s social world was so large encompassing not only Americans but those of many nationalities-that identification is difficult. The art historian Sue Carson Joyner has suggested that the male standing on the far right is a self-portrait. Stewart usually idealized his female figures, giving them handsome, aristocratic profiles, so the similarities among female figures in his paintings can be misleading. The painting was probably not a specific commission, for Stewart was too wealthy to need such work, nor would he have offered it for sale if it were. The painting probably records the baptism of a friend\u2019s child, indicated by the faint inscription of a day and time on the back of the painting, but was not intended to record the event for the public. The Baptism was the culmination of Stewart\u2019s development of elaborate multifigured scenes; thereafter he limited his compositions to smaller groupings. Although the identities of the people remain an enigma, the painting can be appreciated on its own terms. It is a tour de force of technical skill and a prime example of late nineteenth-century academic aesthetics. The persuasiveness of Stewart\u2019s depiction of natural light suggests the fascination with outdoor effects that were just emerging in his art. The picture met with great acclaim at an international exposition held in Berlin in 1895. The realistic illusion of the rich damask wall coverings, the silk, satin, and lace trim of the figures\u2019 attire, and the soft, delicately rendered skin of the women and children captivate viewers even today.",

      "label" : "The son of expatriate William Stewart (a wealthy owner of Cuban sugar plantations), Julius Stewart was raised abroad. After studying with French and Spanish academic artists, he turned to figure painting, becoming a master of genre scenes of the fashionable elite. Many of his paintings were large-scale compositions with numerous figures; all illustrated an extravagant lifestyle in great detail. Although Stewart usually depicted the carefree existence of the leisure class, The Baptism is a more solemn occasion \u2013 an Episcopal priest officiates in bringing a newborn infant into the Anglican church. That the event occurred in a lavishly decorated home may suggest that the mother of the newborn was too ill to attend a church service. Although the painting originally had an inscription indicating the date and time of the scene, all attempts to identify the event have proved inconclusive. If the painting were a commission, then Stewart\u2019s patron never accepted the finished canvas, because it was for sale when exhibited in 1897. The patron may have declined the painting, as details in it hint at the death of the newborn\u2019s mother. Not only does she appear thoroughly exhausted as she reclines on the chaise lounge, but she holds her right hand a small bouquet of violets, the floral symbol of death.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

He painted in Mexico with Alson Clark (1876-1949) in the summer of 1923 and was among the first North American artists to appreciate the pictorial potential of that country, which he continued to paint for most of his career.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Burlesque is related in theme and composition to Benton\u2019s New School for Social Research mural project America Today of 1930-31 and may have served as a study for it. The theatrical scene expresses the artist\u2019s new interest in contemporary urban life, first demonstrated in Bootleggers, 1927 (Reynolda House, Museum of American Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina) and expanded in America Today. Benton was fond of depicting burlesque dancers and strippers and wrote nostalgically of a Fourteenth Street theater where the strippers \"used to make the old boys drool at the mouth and keep their hands in their pockets\" (An Artist in America, p. 269).The burlesque dancer -- with her vigorously thrusting elbow, head, and buttocks -- is similar in gesture to the cavorting performer in the upper-right corner of the City Activities panel in the America Today mural. In the finished mural Benton omitted the audience since all the mural images are only fragmentary scenes, one overlapping another, arranged to convey the hustle and bustle of twentieth-century American life. While Benton presented a more complete view of a theater in Burlesque, the easel painting shares with the mural panels a similar compositional approach: the theater interior is arranged in segmented groupings, the stage, orchestra, balcony, and boxes conceived as irregular shapes that fit together. Moreover, the large, arcing forms of the stage and balcony in the museum\u2019s painting echo the decorative molding that divides various scenes in the mural.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Although Brackman later became the bête noir of the modernists, he apparently had trouble placing his works in national exhibitions during the early 1920s: \"The academicians found me too modern and the moderns, too academic,\" he recalled in an interview in 1961. Indeed, the modernist elements found in A Song continued to influence his art even after his study of the Renaissance masters had led him toward a very deliberate classicism. As a young man he had admired the styles of Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), Claude Monet (1840-1926), Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), and other French painters. His overriding interest in the effects of light and color-which was derived from the impressionists and proved to be the foundation of his technique as a painter -- can be readily detected in A Song. From the works of Cézanne, whom he acknowledged as the source for his lifelong enthusiasm for still life, Brackman derived the use of rich color for modeling, faceted forms, tilted tabletops, and a balance of two-dimensional and threedimensional elements. With its strong color, disorienting perspective, and boisterous energy, A Song reflects these influences more directly than his better known, more classical works.The singer\u2019s shirt and the samovar may refer to the artist\u2019s Russian origins, but because of the singer\u2019s expression and the angle of his face it is difficult to determine whether the painting was intended as a self-portrait. The combination of a seminude figure with a still life in a studio setting was to become a familiar Brackman theme. A Song was one of numerous paintings by Brackman owned by the music publisher Irving Mills, an early patron.The inscriptions on the canvas and its verso may be by different hands. The last digit in the date on the front is ambiguous, suggesting 3, 5, or 6. A review of Brackman\u2019s 1926 exhibition at Babcock Galleries in New York definitely identifies this painting as The Song. Given the prominence of the samovar, however, it is possible that the painting may have been exhibited the year before as The Samovar in his one-man show at the Milch Galleries.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Eliot Clark referred to this landscape as \"one of the most dramatic and powerful pictures painted by Wyant,\" expressive of \"the unrelenting and irresistible force of nature.\" Wyant depicted a desolate land, devoid of any human presence, with only one tree sturdy enough to survive, and the painting was mistakenly referred to in 1912 as No Man\u2019s Land. Storm clouds move quickly over the wild marshy land, solitary stream, and ragged rocks, which cast threatening, dark shadows. While Wyant was preoccupied with light, atmosphere, and weather, Any Man's Land is one of his stormiest landscapes. His earth-toned palette has become even more somber, and his colors--browns, yellow ochers, grays, dark greens, blacks, and white--serve as visual equivalents of nature's ominous mood.The loose brushwork in the artist's late paintings is usually attributed to the physical disability he suffered after his stroke. Any Man's Land, however, demonstrates that Wyant's late painterly handling was not a result of technical inability but was deliberately employed as an expressive element. The forceful strokes in the clouds and sky echo the movement of the threatening storm, and the vigorous scumbling of the rocks and distant terrain express the wildness of the land. Air and earth seem to merge as the wind whips through, and all becomes ethereal. So removed from strict representation had Wyant become that his art verged on abstraction.Wyant's brushwork and emphasis on mood rather than place would date this as a late work. The art historian Robert S. Olpin places it in the artist's last years, dating it about 1887-92. A painting with the same title was exhibited in the 1880 annual exhibition of the Society of American Artists, however, and the notices the exhibited landscape received in several newspaper reviews accord with the appearance of the museum's painting. Any Man's Land therefore was painted much earlier than previously considered and demonstrates that Wyant's turn toward a personal, abstract art began earlier than art historians previously thought.",

      "label" : "Alexander Wyant, along with George Inness and Albert Ryder, was responsible for transforming landscape painting in the United States. In the late 1870s, these painters began to express specific moods and emotional experiences rather than simply delineating physical locales. Any Man\u2019s Land is one of Wyant\u2019s most haunting moodscapes. The desolate, wide-open field is devoid of any human presence and depicts what Eliot Clark, the artist\u2019s biographer, called \u201cthe unrelenting and irresistible force of nature.\u201d The entire scene is painted in neutral earth tones \u2013 browns, ochres, beiges and blacks \u2013 perfectly suited to the turbulent, stormy sky that fills half of the composition. On the back of the canvas an alternate title \u2013 No Man\u2019s Land \u2013 was later written and crossed out; that title seems more fitting than the original one, as the landscape is quite inhospitable, not welcoming even to the viewer. Especially remarkable is the loosely painted surface: Wyant applied his brush quickly, whipping, dragging, and swirling it to create scumbled passages. Details are difficult to discern, and the entire effect verges on abstraction. The frame surrounding the painting is quite appropriate for the landscape. It was manufactured either by or for William Clausen, a New York picture and frame dealer, around 1900. Its rich surface consists of symmetrically arranged scrollwork and acanthus leaves, in the style of French Barbizon-school frames.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Although Cole made his early reputation with his romantic interpretations of the American wilderness, his chief interest was in ideal landscapes rather than realistic depictions of specific locations. He painted his first pair of ideal compositions, The Garden of Eden, 1828 (unlocated), and Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, 1828 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), even before his first trip to Europe in 1829, by which time he already had compiled a long list of ideal subjects; among them the paired titles L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. Paired and serial paintings were to occupy much of his interest and best efforts over the following years. A commission from the collector Charles M. Parker permitted Cole to undertake the paintings L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. On January 8, 1844, Cole wrote to Parker: \"I intend to commence two pictures, to be called L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. In the first picture, I should represent a sunny luxuriant landscape, with figures engaged variously in gay pastimes or pleasant occupation. In the second picture, I would represent some ivy clad ruin in the solemn evening twilight, with a solitary figure musing among the decaying grandeur .... The subject ... is one upon which I can work conamore.\" The paintings are dated 1845 and were exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in the spring of 1846, but with the titles Italian Sunset and View of Lago de Nemi, near Rome. Il Penseroso is based fairly closely upon a detailed view of Lake Nemi with the town of Nemi that Cole had drawn in 1832. He drew the shrine on the notebook\u2019s facing page, as a repositioned foreground element of the landscape, and transferred its design to the painting with the same degree of fidelity, leading one to conclude that the shrine was an actual structure, possibly at that location. The trees behind the shrine and figure before it are the only major elements not present in the drawing. In contrast to Il Penseroso\u2019s specific and realistic portrayal, L\u2019Allegro seems to be a completely ideal and imaginary landscape. The conventionally picturesque composition resembles a sketch now apparently misidentified as a study for the 1838 painting A Dream of Arcadia. To this framework Cole introduced various architectural elements. The art historian Wayne Craven has pointed out the resemblance of the Doric colonnade in the left distance to the early Greek temples in Italy that Cole had traveled to see and paint in 1832 and 1842. The other ruins are more difficult to identify specifically. The right foreground arches, which resume on the other side of the river, could be the remains of a Roman bridge, but they also recall the Claudian aqueduct painted by Cole on several occasions. The brickwork, however, is unlike that in Cole\u2019s other depictions of the monument. The softness of Cole\u2019s rendering of the circular temple on the extreme right suggests that he did not intend to depict any specific ruin. The hilltop town near the center of the painting likewise has a generalized, ideal quality, unlike the detailed accuracy of Cole\u2019s rendering of the town of Nemi in Il Penseroso. Whereas Il Penseroso is an actual view, L\u2019Allegro belongs to the tradition of ideal arcadian landscapes composed by Cole and many others of his generation and earlier. The titles Il Penseroso and L\u2019Allegro refer to a pair of poems by John Milton, one characterizing a cheerful and the other a melancholy outlook. Cole\u2019s landscapes contain none of the setting and specific detail of the poems (except, in a general sense, for the dance in L\u2019Allegro), but they do present contrasting moods. Rather than illustrating the poems, the paintings translate their overall meaning into the visual language of landscape. The pair represents approximately the same time of day, late afternoon, but the degree of brightness and relative warmth of the light differ because of the terrain. The horizon of L\u2019Allegro is low, the foreground water reflecting even more of the generous expanse of sky. The distance of the one large hill contributes to the feeling of openness and light. The scene is bathed in the warm Claudian light of contentment. In a landscape filled with references to antiquity, the foreground dancer, his pose modeled after the Dancing Faun from the House of the Faun in Pompeii (Museo Nazionale, Naples), suggests the survival of a pagan strain among the peasants of the day, as had Donatello in Hawthorne\u2019s The Marble Faun. L\u2019Allegro evokes the innocent joyfulness of the arcadian ideal. In contrast, the encircling walls of Lake Nemi\u2019s crater in Il Penseroso shut out both light and sky, their shaggy slopes looming ominously. The painting is both darker and cooler than L\u2019Allegro. The rough foreground foliage and forested background seem more agitated than the broad expanse of smoothness of L\u2019Allegro. Although the foreground of Il Penseroso is near the Grove of Diana, off to the left, and the site recalls the pagan past (with some of its most somber associations), the painting is dominated by associations with Italy\u2019s Christian piety: a shrine to the Virgin built upon the medieval fortifications of Nemi. In contrast to the merry peasants of L\u2019Allegro, the foreground figure kneels with an abjectness suggesting grief. The pair of paintings expresses the sense of Milton\u2019s poems in terms of highly sophisticated concepts-in the opposition of the conventions of picturesque and sublime landscape and in terms of Italian architectural and intellectual history. As embodied in these paintings, Cole\u2019s concept of ideal landscape is so rich with intellectual and poetic content that the two form a complex unit, depending upon each other for their complete meaning.",

      "label" : "Thomas Cole derived the settings for most of his imaginative themes from his experiences in Italy. He preferred to present his ideas in serial paintings set in picturesque landscapes cluttered with crumbling arches, classical aqueducts, and temples, as in this pair. Although L\u2019Allegro does not represent a specific site, Il Penseroso is based on pencil drawings Cole made of Lake Nemi, near Rome. Cole seems to suggest that despite all of mankind\u2019s achievements, it is nature that is eternal, blessed by a higher spirit than mere humanity. The intertwined foliate motif on this frame incorporates scrollwork and natural vegetation, here leaves and berries, in an American adaptation from filigreed Louis XIV models. This frame is the original one and is characteristic of those Cole used for his 1830s and 1840s landscapes.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",

The ruins in this painting are probably those of San Juan Capistrano, for other paintings of that mission inscribed with dates place Villa there in October 1920. Founded in 1776 by Father Junipero Serra, the San Juan Capistrano mission was one of twenty-one built by the Spaniards. After suffering extensive damage in an earthquake in December 1812, the church was used only as a warehouse, and many of the structure\u2019s stones and tiles taken for use elsewhere.

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "This landscape came into the collection with the title An Inlet of Long Island Sound. The setting has recently been identified as Almy\u2019s Pond, near Newport, Rhode Island. This low-lying area of the Rhode Island coast, with its rolling hills and salt marshes, was a popular site with American artists at mid-century and was painted by Martin Johnson Heade (1819-1904) and William Trost Richards (1833-1905) as well as Kensett. The numerous landscapes of the Newport vicinity listed in the sales catalogue of his estate indicate that Kensett often worked in the area. The museum\u2019s painting may be one of the three Almy\u2019s Pond scenes of similar size sold at auction in 1873 (New York, Association Hall, The Collection of Over Five Hundred Paintings and Studies by the Late John E. Kensett, nos. 366, 454, 559; another painting of the same subject and similar size believed to be one of these three is in the Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago). A very similar landscape painted around 1860 from the same vantage point that recently appeared on the art market (see Related Work) suggests that the museum\u2019s canvas was painted about the same time. In the museum\u2019s painting Kensett viewed the pond, which once was an inlet of the Rhode Island Sound, looking toward the nearby sound, indicated by the large sailboats in the distance. The topography well suited Kensett\u2019s temperament for serene, open landscapes. The museum\u2019s painting typifies the artist\u2019s mature luminist images of the 1860s. It is a tranquil view of nature on a sunny day with a clear, almost cloudless sky dominating the horizontal composition. Little activity occurs. The cattle grazing do not disturb the harmony of the composition, allowing the viewer to attain a transcendental unity with nature; even Kensett\u2019s thin, smooth brushwork keeps from intruding upon the illusion of contact with nature.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "This is an early painting, probably of the late 1930s, which was exhibited in Messick\u2019s first solo exhibition. It demonstrates his socialrealist tendencies in its depiction of ordinary people engaged in everyday activities of a life that is far from luxurious but is still respectable. A man shares a newspaper with a faceless woman while an elderly gentleman hungrily slurps his soup in a sparsely furnished restaurant.Main Street Cafe Society is painted in a palette of earth tones. Color was essential to Messick for conveying the mood of his scenes, and he usually selected a restricted color scheme for each painting. While the browns and beiges of this painting bespeak a poor and spare life, the overall pink cast of the palette suggests a positive, almost rosy attitude toward it. Messick also believed a good composition should move rhythmically, and in Main Street Cafe Society the viewer proceeds through the scene by means of fluid lines and alternating areas of light and dark. Messick was a master draftsman, and it is not surprising that his linear, expressive painting style was often compared with Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s fluid, linear style. Messick heard Benton lecture at the California Arts Club when he visited Los Angeles in 1937.Messick usually produced a number of preliminary sketches for each work. A lithograph that differs in some details may have been based either on the museum\u2019s painting or on a study for it. Messick usually worked from such sketches rather than painting from a model.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "Although his figure paintings often focused on the common laborer, Kirk\u2019s still lifes presented a more refined world, usually depicting works of art, oriental porcelains, and textiles arranged around large floral bouquets. In Rhapsody the artist included a print, a covered lacquer dish, a book, and a large arrangement of dried flowers and leaves in a gleaming copper pitcher.The highly varied palette of deep hues contributes to the painting\u2019s rich elegance. Kirk\u2019s tabletop arrangements were in the tradition of the work of Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) but took on a rigidly standardized format. He repeatedly used the same objects, viewed them from an elevated viewpoint, and only slightly varied their positions within a triangular arrangement before a wall. For example, the same arrangement and bouquet in Rhapsody are found in Tropical Leaves, n.d. (unlocated, reproduced in Weinper, Kirk, p. 59). It is primarily his use of texture and color that distinguishes one still-life painting from another.According to labels on the back of the canvas and stretchers, the painting was widely exhibited under the titles Rhapsody and Tropical Leaves, but attempts to verify these exhibitions have been futile or resulted in contradictory information.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Granville Redmond came to prominence as a landscape painter at a time when ideal, tonal landscapes were painted by a substantial percentage of artists both in Southern California and internationally. Foggy, nocturnal, and twilight scenes in which subdued light suppressed details, flattened space, and reduced the range of color to a dominant tonality were characteristic of his early work in Los Angeles. Although many of his paintings are undated, it seems that Redmond continued the tonal style throughout much of his career alongside the brightly colored impressionist scenes that he began to paint about 1912 and for which he is known today. In an interview in 1931 Redmond complained that he preferred to paint pictures of solitude and silence but could only sell poppy fields (in Millier, \"Our Artists in Person\"). The distinctness of the brushstrokes, uniform in length and direction, creating a tapestrylike quality similar to that in the museum\u2019s California Poppy Field, c. 1926, suggests that Landscape was painted later in Redmond\u2019s career, after the formation of his mature style. It is among the largest and most developed of his later tonal landscapes.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "During World War I, when he worked as a mapmaker for the federal government, Grabach traveled to New York every day. He was so struck by the visual image of laundry dancing on clotheslines strung between the upper stories of tenement buildings and the activity of the inhabitants crowding the streets of the poor sections of the city that in the early 1920s he created a series devoted to the theme of wash day. Pushcart Vendors is one of the major paintings from the series. Grabach added to the view of clean white laundry fluttering in the wind an array of peddlers selling their wares from portable pushcarts. The locale was identified as New York when it was exhibited in 1924. Grabach was close friends with GEORGE LUKS and acquainted with the urban scenes of the Ash Can painters, and his paintings of lower-class New York neighborhoods were no doubt inspired by their example.As did the Ash Can artists, Grabach created an image of lower-class city life without an element of dreariness, one characterized by constant activity and energy. A decade separates Grabach\u2019s street scenes from those of the original Ash Can painters, however. Grabach, reflecting his earlier impressionist and postimpressionist concerns, showed a greater interest in the decorative quality of images. Unlike GEORGE BELLOWS in his Cliff Dwellers, 1913 (LACMA; q.v.), Grabach viewed the city from above, from a distance that prevented the artist and now the viewer from becoming immersed in the activity below. This high vantage point also led the artist to flatten the view, to literally pile the alleyways and buildings one on top of another rather than depicting the scene in depth. The two-dimensionality of the scene was further enhanced by the canvas\u2019s high horizon line and almost square format. Grabach utilized formal devices that create the impression of liveliness, and he often incorporated diagonals into his compositions to intensify the sense of movement. In Pushcart Vendors the entire scene is set on an angle, with the wall that separates the buildings from the street functioning as the major diagonal. The wash on the clotheslines forms a counterpoint to the alley and buildings, thereby activating the densely packed scene. Grabach also used a greater variety of colors with less concern for pseudoscientific theory than did Bellows in Cliff Dwellers. Buildings are red, blue, white, and brown, the distant sky lavender, and a patch of grass sparkling green, and these colors flicker across the scene.",

His late selfportraits are virtually the only examples of his skill at portraiture that are known today.This painting was commissioned by Samuel Lustgarten (1888-1971), according to his son Alfred Lustgarten. A Chicago businessman and avid art collector, Samuel Lustgarten owned many of Ufer\u2019s Taos scenes. The artist was a frequent visitor to the Lustgarten family\u2019s home in Chicago and often dined with the family (Alfred Lustgarten, telephone conversation with Ilene Susan Fort, July 31, 1986).",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

      "curator notes" : "In 1933 Speicher met Vincent Moore, a farmer from Glenford, New York, a village three miles from Woodstock. Speicher first saw Moore, who was nicknamed \"Red\" because of his red hair and formidable moustache, swinging a hammer in his blacksmith shop and was so struck by his exceptional physical presence that he persuaded Moore to pose for him. Eventually Moore became one of Speicher\u2019s favorite models, sitting for him every year for five years, but only in the autumn after the farming and hunting seasons. What resulted was a series of drawings and paintings in which the artist was able to convey the strength and ruggedness of this modern version of Longfellow\u2019s \"Village Blacksmith,\" as one critic referred to him.Speicher usually depicted the brawny Moore wearing work clothes-a rough shirt, pants, and heavy shoes-characteristic of the rural American laborer. (Speicher thought of him as an independent son of the soil.) He placed Moore in interior settings natural for him, often with different implements indicative of his manly activities: an anvil and wheel for this blacksmith scene, a gun for the painting of Moore as a hunter, and a table laden with food for the image of Moore as a farmer. A restrained palette was typical of Speicher, and here the choice of browns was exceptionally well suited for underscoring the rugged, masculine quality of the image. Further conveying Moore\u2019s physical power is his assertive gesture of crossing his muscular arms over his broad chest.The painting was exhibited in several major American cities during the mid-1930s, winning awards that confirmed Speicher\u2019s being one of the most important figure painters of the day. Although his approach to the figure was conservative, Speicher\u2019s handling was that of a modernist, for he built form with a soft, but square, planar and economical brushstroke. The artist was commended for this \"direct painting\" in a review of the Whitney Biennial.Speicher painted another version of Moore as a blacksmith (see Related Works). His reason for creating this other version is not known nor is the chronology. The two blacksmith paintings were the only images of Moore that Speicher made as full-length figures, and they are among the most monumental of his images. Speicher\u2019s romantic conception of such rural American figures seems to be midway between the classicism of academic painting and American regionalism.",

By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters.

A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life.

      "curator notes" : "McFee\u2019s tabletop still lifes remained consistent throughout his career. They always contain the same basic components: a wood table that is tilted toward the viewer, and often draped with some fabric, with an array of objects atop it. An assortment of fruit, arranged around and on plates or in other containers, was usually placed near a potted plant or vase of flowers, as in Still Life with Carafe. After the 1910s McFee\u2019s still lifes often featured a glass object, no doubt because the reflective and transparent qualities of the glass enabled him to explore his modernist fascination with forms and planes. The faceted, cut-glass decanter in the museum\u2019s painting seems to have been especially appealing to the artist, for he used it in several other still lifes of the 1930s. The arrangement in the museum\u2019s painting is slightly more elaborate than in most of his other compositions, since, following an old still-life tradition, McFee presented both whole and cut fruit. He also included in the background of this painting a second table with books placed on it.Although McFee\u2019s still-life compositions of his mature years appear more traditional than his early abstractions, they continue to demonstrate the artist\u2019s fundamental loyalty to Paul Cézanne (1839-1906). In the use of a simple table, the type of still-life arrangement, and an emphasis on cubic form, McFee followed Cézanne\u2019s example, but he gave a greater sense of depth to the overall scene. His mature still lifes also reveal his personal exploration of painting techniques. As did Dasburg, McFee presented his objects not in flat, opaque planes but in layers of delicately brushed pigments that give a soft, almost shimmering quality to his surfaces. The objects appear both solid and delicate. In Still Life with Carafe the overall gray tonality is infused with a wealth of other colors-deep green, alizarin, warm brown, and orange-that are repeated throughout. The overall appearance of a McFee painting is one of great sensuality.",

      "curator notes" : "In 1912 Grabach moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts, drawn there by the landscape of this section of the Connecticut River Valley. Until he moved back to New Jersey in 1915, he devoted much of his time to painting winter landscapes -- possibly inspired by the snowy scenes of JOHN TWACHTMAN -- that were well received at the National Academy of Design annuals. During the late nineteenth century artists had begun using such images as a means to explore the potential of the color white, but by Grabach\u2019s time such interest was more of a decorative nature. In true impressionist fashion Grabach found much color in the snowy image: a setting sun casts a golden orange on the rooftops, while cooler pastels of green and lavender describe the shadows. The impastoed brushwork is somewhat controlled in the delineation of the forms of the houses, but looser for the field of snow. The canvas is an exact square, a format popular with early twentieth-century impressionists and post-impressionists, as were a high viewpoint and brushwork that served to emphasize the picture plane. The buildings and yards are read as flat shapes in a jigsaw-puzzle arrangement. As Sunlit Houses is a view of a town, it foreshadows Grabach\u2019s later urban images and probably was done just before he left Greenfield.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",
      "curator notes" : "The museum\u2019s portrait was painted in 1762, at the peak of the artist\u2019s abilities. The previous year Hesselius had obtained the prestigious commission to paint the portraits of the four children of Benedict Calvert, 1761 (Baltimore Museum of Art). Having begun his career under the stylistic influence of Robert Feke, he had by this point come under the influence of John Wollaston (active 1736-1767), who then was working in the mid-Atlantic region. In his mature work a sculptural feeling for clear forms and volumes recalls the work of Feke. The head, for instance, is isolated as a distinct form, high on a thin neck, its shapes slightly simplified and clarified. The heavy, lidded, almond eyes betray the example of Wollaston, as do the decorative elaboration of lace and extensive patterning of highlights in the drapery. More his own is Hesselius\u2019s use of strong color, in this case a brilliant blue in the dress and bright pink in the shawl, echoed in the high color of the face. The museum\u2019s painting is exceptionally well preserved for the work of Hesselius and consequently unusually impressive. The subject was born in 1742 or 1743, the daughter of Samuel Chew III of Anne Arundel County and his wife Sarah Lock. The museum\u2019s painting is one of four portraits of members of the Chew family executed by Hesselius in 1762. One is a portrait of Elizabeth\u2019s mother, another is of Elizabeth\u2019s brother, Samuel Lloyd Chew (both unlocated), and the fourth is another version of the portrait of Elizabeth (Brooklyn Museum). The other version is smaller (28 3/8 x 25 1/8 inches), and only a bust-length, with Elizabeth Smith wearing a silver dress, with blue bow, and chocolate-colored shawl and holding a sprig of flowers in a slightly different gesture. In 1939 the museum\u2019s painting was the only one of this group of four not in the collection of Samuel Claggett Chew of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. The fact that the museum\u2019s painting descended through Mrs. Smith\u2019s family rather than the Chew family suggests the possibility that it was commissioned separately by Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Since Elizabeth Chew was married on February 11, 1762, it is possible that the present painting was a marriage portrait. Her first husband was John Hamilton Smith, a resident and plantation owner of Calvert County; they had two daughters, Elizabeth Chew and Mary. Her half-sister, Mary, married a Dr. Alexander Hamilton Smith in 1767. (There was a prominent Scottish physician of the same name living in Annapolis in the 1740s.) Records for Saint James\u2019s (Old Herring Creek) Parish show a large family with the name of Smith living there in the early eighteenth century. Elizabeth Chew Smith later married a man named Sprigg. It is not known whether this second marriage produced issue. She died sometime after 1800.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "During the decade Cotton spent in the Los Angeles area he adopted the plein-air approach to landscape painting that was so popular among local artists. Landscape is a typical example: the tall, thin, eucalyptus trees frame hilly, broadly rolling terrain, and a shadowy foreground serves as a contrast to the brilliant sunlit mountains. The palette consists of soft yellow-ochers, harmonious sunny greens, and cool lavenders.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Portrait of Cecilia Tower was one of Shannon\u2019s early mature works, painted and exhibited the year immediately following his first major critical success. He became best known for his portraits of women, and the museum\u2019s painting is characteristic of the type of decorative figure painting that brought him fame. Cecilia Tower is presented in neutral surroundings, allowing her dignified attitude, handsome attire, and the large size of the canvas to convey her social importance. Following Whistler in viewing a portrait first as a work of art and typical of progressive artists allied with the Aesthetic movement, Shannon held that portraiture was more than merely reproducing a physical likeness of the sitter. In his portraits of women the refined beauty of all the formal elements-color, line, and composition-suggest elegance and wealth. Cecilia Tower wears a fashionable silk evening gown and a boa. The painting is an orchestration of gray tints. Shannon preferred a palette of softly modulated tones, and the lavenders and pearl grays of this canvas, along with pinks, were among his favorite hues. Delicacy of color contributes to the elegance of his portraits. Whistler\u2019s example inspired a host of later artists to employ soft, tonally limited palettes and place their sitters in spare environments and shallow spaces. Another characteristic of Aesthetic movement portraits found in Cecilia Tower is that of showing the sitter full-length and in life-size. The sitter was a member of the Tower family, landed gentry from Weald Hall in Essex. Cecilia Tower may have been Mrs. Christopher Tower. A portrait by Shannon of a child, Hugh Christopher Tower (unlocated), the son of Christopher Tower, was exhibited in the winter 1890-91 exhibition at the London Institute of Painters in Oil-Colours only a few years after Portrait of Cecilia Tower was shown in London. According to the art historian Barbara Dayer Gallati Shannon was often commissioned to paint different members of the same family.",

      "curator notes" : "Throughout his career Twachtman was attracted to harbors and scenes of shipping, and he painted harbors in Venice; the New York area; Newport, Rhode Island; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Gloucester, Massachusetts. It is on the basis of its style that this harbor view is identified as a scene in Gloucester, where, during the last three summers of his short life, Twachtman developed a distinctive, new manner. Gloucester was both a resort and an active fishing town. Twachtman had received one of his earliest, favorable critical notices for the freshness of the views he painted in 1879 of unpicturesque wharves and shipping in New York harbor. In Gloucester he painted the countryside, but also close-up scenes of the ordinary wharves and fishing fleet. In this painting he seems to have set up his easel on the roof of one of the low sheds along the wharves, with one of the larger buildings to his left and behind him. This viewpoint looks down upon the deck of a large ship. judging from the forward position of the two masts that are visible, this may be a three-masted vessel, presumably one of the large Italian barks that brought salt for processing the fish in Gloucester. Much larger than the two-masted fishing schooners, the barks were higher in the water, their decks also higher than the level of the wharves built for the schooners. Twachtman used a high vantage point in some of the other paintings he did in Gloucester, producing a similarly high horizon line, which, together with the tilted-up foreground and square format of the canvas, tends to deny the illusion of spacial recession. The surface grid, which is suggested by the way the parallel masts intersect the top edge of the painting and the horizon line parallel to it, also contributes to an awareness of the picture\u2019s surface and the denial of depth. Counteracting these formal features is another familiar in the Gloucester paintings, the powerful, thrusting diagonal into space, along the length of the bark. An increased consciousness of pictorial geometry, its clear expression, and its use for dramatic effect are characteristic of Twachtman\u2019s more explicit picture-making in his Gloucester paintings. The design of Harbor Scene, painted on Twachtman\u2019s largest canvas size of the period, is so strong that it reads clearly and forcefully even though the painting remained unfinished. Stimulated by the momentary scene and interested in problems of pictorial design, he began numerous paintings in Gloucester that he did not carry to completion. One sees in these unfinished paintings, as well as in the finished ones, a vigor of paint handling not seen in Twachtman\u2019s work since his early period in Munich. His classic paintings of the previous decade employed underpainting to produce very delicate effects of limited color and value. The Gloucester pictures were painted directly, with the direction and texture of the paint clearly visible. The color is stronger, the contrasts greater, and the action of paint application is a matter of separate interest. The vigor and exceptional skill of Twachtman\u2019s brush command attention in Harbor Scene.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",

Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "ROBERT W. WEIR, the father of the artist and also of the painter JOHN FERGUSON WEIR, was born in New York, New York, in 1803. He studied for three years in Florence and Rome, returning to New York in 1827. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Design two years later. He was instructor in drawing at the United States Military Academy from 1834 to 1876 and is best known for his paintings of historical subjects, such as Embarkation of the Pilgrims, 1837- 43 (Capitol Rotunda, Washington, D.C.). He died in New York in 1889. Robert W. Weir was J. Alden Weir\u2019s first teacher and continued to give his son advice and encouragement later in life. The son retained a deep admiration for his father and freely acknowledged his debt to him. Among the first paintings he undertook after his return from study in Paris were a portrait of his father exhibited in 1878 at the National Academy of Design, and a study for the portrait, exhibited at the Society of American Artists. When J. Alden Weir painted his self-portrait for the National Academy of Design in 1886, he acknowledged his debt to his father by including the finished portrait of 1878 in the background. (He also executed a watercolor study, c. 1878 [private collection], possibly in preparation for this important early portrait.) The museum\u2019s portrait of Robert Weir is quite unlike the portrait of 1878 and was painted about seven years later. The earlier work\u2019s dramatic pose and conventional studio lighting from the side and above have been replaced by a direct gaze and frontal illumination. The lack of depth, flat lighting, and discrete brushstrokes in this portrait of his father and the accompanying one of Mrs. Weir may reflect the artist\u2019s interest during these years in the work of Edouard Manet (1832-1883). At the same time the example of the old masters is strong in all his early work. Daughter of an Episcopal priest, Susan Martha Bayard was born in 1817. She taught school before joining the household of Robert W. Weir in 1845 to help raise his nine children after the death of his first wife. On July 15, 1846, they were married, and she bore him seven more children. Most of the sons followed military careers, but John Ferguson Weir, a child of the first marriage, and J. Alden Weir, her youngest son, became artists. Mrs. Weir died in 1900.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",

From the 1890s through the 1910s he moved away from the impressionistic recording of natural scenes to develop a more personal mode of expression. Though Prendergast painted classic impressionist motifs \u2013 the beach, park strollers, quiet harbors \u2013 throughout his career, he actually was not interested in subject matter per se. He preferred to experiment with formal elements, conceiving of them abstractly. Cove, Maine marks the beginning of Prendergast\u2019s move to a more avant-garde aesthetic. During a 1907 visit to Paris he was staggered by the art of Paul Cezanne, which was presented at a major retrospective, as well as by the intimist paintings of Edouard Vuillard and the fauves. He noted a \u201cnew impulse\u201d in his work arising from the experience. He loosened his brushwork further so that it took an energetic life of its own. The canvas became a tapestry of color and movement analogous to the melody and rhythm of music. He would often construct his compositions literally on the canvas, rather than conceiving of them in preparatory drawings, by first applying then changing the placement of his brushstrokes. With such color symphonies Prendergast advanced the cause of modern art in the United States during the years prior to the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced European modernism to this country.",

By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Following his 1910 trip to Morocco, Tanner painted many scenes of Tangiers and exhibited them in Chicago at Thurber Art Galleries in 1911 and in New York at M. Knoedler & Co. in 1913. Although Moonlight: Walls of Tangiers has traditionally been dated 1914, based on William Preston Harrison\u2019s authority, the painting may have been executed earlier, for several of the works exhibited in 1913 have similar titles, in particular one painting entitled Moonrise: Walls of Tangiers. Although the North African locale provided the same exotic scenery incorporated in Tanner\u2019s religious images, the Moroccan scenes are not religious. The elimination of a narrative may have assisted Tanner in his exploration of the formal aspects of painting, for it is just during these prewar years that his art underwent its last stylistic change. Tanner used his views of the streets, walls, and arcades of the city to explore the phenomena of color and light, not in an analytical manner as did the impressionists, but rather in harmony with both his own romanticism and turn-of-the-century tonalist trends in Europe and the United States. The Moroccan paintings are all vague, shadowy scenes painted in one predominant hue with thick, scumbled passages over rich glazing on a white ground. The blue and green palette of Moonlight: Walls of Tangiers has shades of yellow, peach, and purple. Tanner had begun to experiment with pigments and glazes around 1907 and by World War I was almost exclusively using the complex technique of layered glazes. Perhaps it was his renewed acquaintance with the Orient that enabled Tanner to develop the more resonant and colorful painting style characteristic of his art from about 1910 until his death in 1937.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States.

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

      "curator notes" : "American art achieved cosmopolitan status in the decades following the nation\u2019s centennial with figure paintings such as The Trial of Constance de Beverly by Toby Rosenthal (1848-1917). Although a scene set in the time of Henry VIII (1491-1547) the large canvas resonates of the 19th century and serves as a barometer of cultural taste. Rosenthal was one of the earliest American expatriate artists to achieve international fame. Prussian-born, he grew up in San Francisco but returned to Europe to enroll in the Royal Academy in Munich. There he was introduced to the academic belief in the superiority of history painting. Under Karl von Piloty, Rosenthal learned how to depict stories of an uplifting, moral character in dramatic, yet easily understood terms. While he lived in Germany, Rosenthal received his most significant commissions from Americans. In 1879 the San Francisco industrialist Irving M. Scott requested a scene from Marmion (1808), a romantic narrative poem by Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). The tale was a favorite of Rosenthal\u2019s patron, whose enthusiasm reflected the popularity of the Scotsman\u2019s writings with the middle-class reading public. Scotts\u2019 influence on 19th-century pictorial arts was equally pervasive, for beginning in the 1820s, his novels revolutionized history painting in Europe and America by providing artists with stories of a human character that had mass appeal. The Trial of Constance de Beverly was a late example of such painting. Marmion is a tale fraught with all the elements of a bestseller: romance, danger, abandonment, and death. The story concerns Constance de Beverly, a beautiful young novice who is seduced into leaving the convent by Lord Marmion, a handsome but eventually faithless suitor. Rosenthal chose not to delineate a romantic episode, but to focus on the tense courtroom drama as Constance awaits her fate at the hands of a clerical tribune. In quite operatic fashion befitting medieval revival novels and history paintings, Rosenthal depicted the moment when a monk plucks Constance\u2019s cloak from her shoulders to reveal her clothed as Lord Marmion\u2019s page: in the background two monks gleefully prepare the niche where she will be bricked-up alive for breaking her religious vows. Rosenthal brilliantly exploited the romantic elements of gothic literature by heightening the sinister, almost ghoulish character of the scene through a cavernous setting, brownish-black palette, tenebrous lighting, and theatrical facial expressions. Rosenthal sought complete accuracy in the details of the setting and costume. He did depart dramatically from the story, however, by omitting Lord Marmion from the trial scene. By doing so, Constance becomes the main protagonist, standing center stage, a heroine despite the tragedy of her situation. Painted during a period when most women still had little control of their own lives, Rosenthal\u2019s Constance was someone who determined her own destiny. After winning a gold medal at the 1883 Munich International Art Exhibition, the painting was exhibited in San Francisco to great acclaim. Saved from the city\u2019s 1906 earthquake and fire through quick thinking, it has remained in California ever since.",

      "curator notes" : "Harnett was a major late-nineteenth-century artist in the United States, and the most important trompe l\u2019oeil still life painter of the era. During the 1870s he worked in Philadelphia and New York City, and by the late 1870s he had established his early reputation with the tightly painted and meticulously realistic table top still lifes. These have been dubbed \u201cbachelor still lifes\u201d because Harnett included objects primarily considered masculine: pipes, bags of tobacco, rugged pottery mugs, and newspapers or other printed material. These bachelor still lifes were all exceptionally small in scale, and painted in a dark, realistic palette. Harnett painted numerous examples, varying them primarily in the arrangement of the objects included. Alas, Poor Yorick (also known as Kilo, Tobacco and Pipe and Materials for a Leisure Hour) is a splendid classic example of Harnett\u2019s early bachelor still lifes, and demonstrates that the artist was already fascinated by the sense of intense realism that would dominate his mature, larger, trompe l\u2019oeil rack paintings.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

The figure in Mme Yup See is fully realized within a traditional approach to modeling and draftsmanship, yet Rich\u2019s postimpressionist handling dominates the picture. The background flickers with long horizontal streaks of pink, ultramarine blue, and yellow, sparkling hues that echo the deeper colors of Mme See\u2019s attire.The See family has a unique history in the Los Angeles area. Fong See, the patriarch, came to this country as a poor immigrant but became one of the richest and most prominent Chinese in the United States. The antique stores owned by his family numbered among their clients, the architects Charles and Henry Greene, the art dealer Grace Nicholson, and eventually the young motion picture companies, which bought Asian wares as props. Yup See\u2019s place within the family has not been determined; however, it seems that Rich intended his painting as a tribute to the Chinese-American community. He placed this beautiful woman among objects of the kind the Sees would have sold. Mme See wears a Qing Dynasty silk robe with an embroidered design based on the nine-dragon motif that was the prerogative of the Chinese royal family and court. The simple frame, with its decoration limited to the corners, was designed and carved by the artist.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

Palmer excelled at meticulous details, here seen in the caned seat and veneer of the Empire chair and the patterned floor decoration. His instruction of several students may have inspired this painting. A young artist is shown seated before an easel, surrounded by the tools of the profession. A portfolio of prints on the floor behind his chair and a partly open book of landscapes show the sources used by the beginner, while the busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin \u2013 similar to works by the Philadelphia sculptor Benamin Rush \u2013 indicate another important field of artistic endeavor.

      "curator notes" : "Raphael Soyer painted members of his family often and throughout his career. Painting Moses, his identical twin, was in many ways creating a self-portrait, for the two not only shared a common profession, they even worked in similar styles. During the decade this portrait was painted, Raphael also created Double Portrait, 1963 (Mrs. George H. Boynton, Tuxedo Park, N.Y.), which depicts the two sitting in a studio with easels cluttering the background.The quiet, tired poignance of his brother is the sole theme of the painting. Moses\u2019s mood might have been the result of his advanced age, but it might just as readily be explained by the preferences of both brother-painters for models who expressed a silent and somewhat resigned sadness. In Raphael\u2019s case this tendency first appeared in the pathos of his scenes of the depression. Raphael often focused on his model\u2019s face as an expression of this mood, and here placed his brother\u2019s relatively small head in the center of a large composition. A cool palette of somber mauves, blue greens, and grays intensifies the mood. The emptiness of the room, with only a drawing tacked to a door in the background, emphasizes Moses\u2019s solitary bearing. Moses is similarly depicted in Raphael\u2019s most famous late work, Homage to Thomas Eakins, 1963-65 (Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), a large, crowded group portrait in which all the artists included appear to be en-tranced and in their own worlds despite the crowded nature of the composition.Raphael always demonstrated a strong sense of design, shown here by his strategic placement of the figure. The fluid application of pigment in almost abstract terms is characteristic of his late, more painterly handling.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Weir seems to indicate in his published Recollections that he began An Artist\u2019s Studio in West Point during the summer of 1862 and returned during the summer of 1863 to finish it, but in an early manuscript of the recollections he wrote that he carried the unfinished canvas with him when he moved to New York in 1861 to set up his own studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building. In a manuscript list of some of his works Weir indicated that An Artist\u2019s Studio was painted in 1863 and 1864. He intended to exhibit the picture for the first time in the spring exhibition of the National Academy of Design in 1864, but the artist SANFORD R. GIFFORD, a friend and neighbor in the Tenth Street Studio Building, admired it enough to borrow it first for an exhibition and reception at the Athenaeum Club. Its favorable reception at the exhibition of the National Academy of Design was Weir\u2019s first great success, causing his election as an associate member of the academy. Even though he raised the price, Weir sold it soon afterward. Robert Weir had introduced his son to the world of art and to numerous leading artists, so it seems appropriate that a painting of the distinguished artist in his studio at West Point should have been John Ferguson Weir\u2019s introduction to the National Academy of Design and the art world of New York. The young Weir had served what he considered an apprenticeship in that studio and wrote of it in the same manuscript draft of the Recollections: \"Brought up in an artist\u2019s studio, surrounded with what was actively related to the practice of art, with opportunity for gaining such knowledge of the past as the collections and library of the house inspired, it only needed a strong incentive to get from this what was requisite in the way of preparations in following one\u2019s bent. At any rate, the results of this experience supplied my equipment when eventually I struck out in the swim and found myself in the Tenth Street Studios.\" The significance the subject had for the young Weir is reflected in the fact that he painted the studio in other works, The Artist\u2019s Studio, 1864 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut), The Studio, 1864 (art market 1976), and The Morning Paper, 1868 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). What apparently is a study for the right side of the museum\u2019s painting is preserved in the West Point Museum. An inventory made in 1914 indicates that he still had at that time two paintings and oil sketches of the interior of a studio, as well as two photographs thought to be of the interior of his father\u2019s studio (New Haven, Yale University, John Ferguson Weir Papers, \"Professor Weir\u2019s Portfolio, Case in Lobby to Store-room, March 1914,\" pp. 4, 5).An Artist\u2019s Studio depicts Robert Weir writing in his studio, surrounded by his own paintings, drawings, and artist\u2019s equipment, as well as antique furniture, armor, and other artifacts assembled by him, for he was conscientious about the accuracy of the details of his history paintings. The very size of the studio, a space of two stories open to the roof, recalled his most famous history painting in that the studio was an addition to his original stone quarters that was built to enable him to paint The Embarkation of the Pilgrims, 1843, for the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington. Two studies for that painting can be seen on the left side of the back wall, the upper one a study for the figure of John Robinson, the pastor, and the lower one a study for those of Miles Standish and his wife. His most recent success, Taking the Veil, 1863 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), is represented as on the large easel in the center of the room. It had been a critical triumph when exhibited in February 1863 in Goupil\u2019s gallery in New York and later, by April of that year, in his son\u2019s Tenth Street studio. The other recognizable images depicted are also ones that had special meaning for Robert Weir: the version of his celebrated painting Saint Nicholas of 1837 (unlocated; one of numerous replicas or later versions, dated 1838, New-York Historical Society) that can be seen near the upper right-hand corner of The Artist\u2019s Studio, and the large bust near it, on top of the cabinet, a replica of a bust of 1840 by Shobal Vail Clevenger (1812-1843) of Washington Allston (1779-1843), esteemed as the greatest American artist of the romantic period. Propped up on the cabinet is an oil sketch of what looks like a Deposition, perhaps a study for the painting, Evening of the Crucifixion, which Robert Weir exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1864 (unlocated). The cabinet had been used as a background in the artist\u2019s painting, The Microscope, 1849 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven). Although surrounded by evidence of his artistic activity and success, Robert Weir is shown writing at his book-lined desk rather than painting. Father and son shared the ideal of the artist as a man of wide reading and a resultingly deep knowledge and rich imagination. An artist of the romantic period thought of himself as a poet, rather than primarily a craftsman, his chief effort being conceptual. Although the painting\u2019s dramatic shadows suggest this lofty realm of the imagination, An Artist\u2019s Studio was developed in terms of clear spatial progression and firm drawing. Henry T. Tuckerman in 1867 praised Robert Weir\u2019s Taking the Veil for its architectural truth and correct drawing (Tuckerman 1867, p. 214), but these qualities were developed much further in his son\u2019s An Artist\u2019s Studio. Robert Weir\u2019s instruction to the cadets in military draftsmanship must have emphasized perspective drawing and clear rendering of details. The son he trained was exceptionally strong in both these areas. At the same time, the painting\u2019s highly detailed quality reflects the taste of the 1860s, as seen in the work of his neighbors in the Tenth Street Studio Building. The entry for the painting in the catalogue of the National Academy of Design\u2019s exhibition included the following poem: \"I well remember how the light, the pale, pure north light, fell On all within that lofty room, and clothed with mystic spell A massive oaken cabinet, and many a curious chair Bright armor of the olden time, and relics quaint and rare. \"I marked them well, --the gathered books, the painter\u2019s treasures all: Here was the resting-place of day, whatever might befall; The inner shrine of one whose brow the stamp of genius bore, And who the laurels of his fame with childlike meekness wore. \"Oh, many a slowly-waning hour this silent room alone Had seen the dreaming artist sit, like statue carved in stone; Absorbed in patient watchfulness of all that Fancy brought, Gleanings of gladness or of gloom from out the fields of thought.\"",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views.

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",
      "curator notes" : "No signed portraits by Badger are known, but on the basis of the style of four documented portraits a large group of paintings similar in style have been attributed to him. The portrait of Sarah Larrabee Edes possesses the characteristics of this style: fairly pastel, chalky colors, outlining of the edges of the linen cuffs and collars, indistinct backgrounds with feathery foliage, and an insufficiency of foreshortening that makes the figures seem to float upon the surface of the painting. Since Badger\u2019s portraits also are not dated, the progression of his stylistic development is not clear, making it hard to assign a date to the present painting. It has been dated about 1760 because that approximate date has been assigned to the portrait of the sitter\u2019s father, Captain John Larrabee. Badger\u2019s Captain John Larrabee, c. 1760 (Worcester [Mass.] Art Museum), is his only full-length adult portrait and easily his finest effort. The subject, born in 1686, was captain lieutenant, or commanding officer, of Castle William (afterwards Fort Independence) in Boston Harbor for nearly forty years before his death on February 11, 1762. In 1710 he married Elizabeth Jordan, and the couple had three children, a son and two daughters. The younger daughter, Sarah, was born on July 12, 1719. On December 21, 1738, she married Thomas Edes (1715-1794), a ship joiner, or carpenter, of Boston. They had ten children. Thomas Edes was one of the executors of Captain Larrabee\u2019s will. An unusual feature of the portrait of Sarah Larrabee Edes is the evidence of significant changes in design, particularly in the position of the hands. Her proper right hand originally was painted as extending further into the lap, and her proper left hand, with its linen sleeve hanging downward, was raised toward her bosom, as though tucking a flower into the neckline, as in Robert Feke\u2019s Mrs. James Bowdoin II, 1748 (Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, Maine).",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In The Tippler Smith combined the types of painting with which she was most identified-figure, landscape, and even still life-to create a pleasant genre scene of a working-class man enjoying a drink. During the late 1930s the artist painted several images of elderly people, endowing each figure with a sense of dignity and strength. Both The Tippler and Time Out, of about the same date (private collection), are half-length figures of robust workmen.While always retaining an impressionist concern for color, Smith painted her mature figure paintings in a darker and richer palette. The silvery gray and purply browns of The Tippler and Time Out enhance the evocation of age and manual labor. Equally rich was Smith\u2019s bravura handling: she built up the form of the man with long, strong strokes of a full brush in the tradition of earlier artists such as WILLIAM M. CHASE and her teacher Tarbell. The unfinished state of the wintry landscape hanging on the back wall to the left further demonstrates the vigor of her handling.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1910, after his marriage, Puthuff moved northeast of Los Angeles to Eagle Rock and then in 1926 moved to the nearby community of La Crescenta. Although he sometimes traveled as far afield as the Grand Canyon and Cuernavaca, Mexico, he preferred to paint the hills and mountains of Southern California. He began visiting the Laguna area in 1907.In this early canvas Puthuff accurately caught the spirit of the gently rolling coastal mountains. After settling in California, Puthuff fell in love with the openness and freedom of such hills. The landscape is a classic example of the eucalyptus school, with its emphasis on the empty, sun-filled hills of Southern California. When this painting was exhibited at a group show during the early years of the new Los Angeles Museum, the Los Angeles Times critic Antony Anderson praised Puthuff for capturing \"the lovely golden brown of Southern California\u2019s hills in summer.\" This palette of soft golds, ochers, and greens as well as the fluid brushwork are characteristic of the lyrical style for which Puthuff was known. The landscape may have been titled Summer Morning at some time.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Theodore Robinson (1852-1896) was one of the most important American Impressionist painters. Valley of the Seine, Giverny dates from Robinson\u2019s first encounter with Giverny, the village where Monet had settled four years before. Robinson was one of a group of four American artists who spent the summer there, establishing the art colony that would be the fountainhead of American Impressionism. Of this group, Robinson was the one who worked most closely with Monet; while never formally his student, it was he who absorbed Monet\u2019s principles most thoroughly. At the same time, Robinson, like most American artists of the day, was also strongly influenced by Whistler (whom he had met in Venice in 1879) and the Aesthetic movement, resulting in a persistent interest in surface and pattern. That is to say, Americans adapted French Impressionism to their own interests and aesthetics; American Impressionism ultimately becomes its own movement, independent of its origins in France.Valley of the Seine, Giverny is a perfect example of this balance. On the one hand, it is a plein-air oil sketch, reproducing one of the topographical features that made Giverny distinctive, the escarpment above the Seine. Our eyes register the brightness of the day, its heat, and the colors of the fields in the broken brushstrokes and pure colors of Impressionist style. At the same time, the most distinctive features of the painting are the large, angular flat lines of the fields that run down the side of the hill and come to an abrupt halt in the horizontal green field below. We read this painting both as a light-filled scene and as a decorative pattern. Indeed, the boldness of the pattern making anticipates the development of the distinctive native modernism that grows out of the teachings of Arthur Wesley Dow and that can be found in the work of O\u2019Keeffe and Dove. In other words, this is a work that rests precisely at the moment in Robinson\u2019s work where he is exploring both the realism of Impressionism and the abstraction of Aestheticism. Robinson\u2019s Valley of the Seine, Giverny is the Museum\u2019s first work by the first generation of Americans who worked at Giverny. Coming from the initial moment when the colony was founded it is also the Museum\u2019s earliest American Impressionist plein-air oil sketch. The painting complements LACMA\u2019s great Marry Cassatt, Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy Child, 1880, Cassatt\u2019s first enunciation of the theme that would dominate her oeuvre. As Cassatt is to Degas, her mentor who formed her style, so is Robinson to Monet; these two works both reveal this fundamental relationship and suggest how each artist differed from her or his mentor. While the Cassatt is a great exhibition figure painting and the Robinson a small-scale landscaped sketch, nonetheless within the careers of these important artists, the two works occupy similarly pivotal places. Much of what makes Robinson\u2019s later landscapes distinctive \u2013 particularly his interest in bold patterns and shapes \u2013 is seen here first in a concentrated form.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "This portrait is signed and dated on the reverse with the Japanese character meaning spring and portrays Stanton Macdonald-Wright's lover Riza Royce, née Riza Maria Marks (1902-1980). Macdonald-Wright was deeply interested in the function of symbols and in myth and spirituality, and many such references surround his sensitive depiction of Royce. At the left are white lilies, symbols of purity and virtue, and irises, which are named for Iris, messenger of the gods in Greek mythology and the personification of the rainbow. The colors of the rainbow appear behind Royce's head in a mountainous landscape dominated by peaks of blue-violet, \"the introspective, the inspirational color.\" The pattern of the red silk dress she wears repeats the yin-yang symbol, which represents the intertwining of the female principle, yin, with the male principle, yang, in Eastern philosophy. An actress of some renown, Royce had been married to prominent Hollywood producer Josef von Sternberg, and she and Macdonald-Wright were involved from the late 1920s through 1933. The increasing seriousness of his relationship with Royce impelled Macdonald-Wright to leave Los Angeles in May of 1932 for New York, where he joined Royce and painted this portrait. In the painting Royce wears a jade bracelet that was a gift to her from Macdonald-Wright very early in their relationship. Reportedly carved from a single piece of jade (there are no seams in the circular pieces), the bracelet is also worn by Royce in a photograph of her taken about 1929-1930. In China, jade is revered for its beauty and spiritual qualities, and the bracelet was probably symbolic to both Macdonald-Wright and Royce on many levels. It descended in the family through their daughter, Linfa Riza Wright (1933-2001), who donated this painting and the three graphite drawings by her father to the museum. The family has always understood that Macdonald-Wright chose his daughter's name, Linfa, which is Chinese for Lotus flower and is another allusion to his abiding interest in the Far East.

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Living an expatriate existence, James McNeil Whistler worked primarily in Europe, first in France, then in England. Yet, he was the single most influential American artist of the nineteenth century, not only in Europe, but also in the United States. His achievement lies at the heart of the late nineteenth-century Aesthetic movement, which prized the idea of \"art for art's sake.\" His argument that art is neither didactic nor natural was a necessary prelude for the development of the radical modernist movements of the twentieth century, primarily abstraction. No American artist of any stature after the Civil War escaped his influence.Whether landscapes, seascapes, or figure studies, Whistler's paintings are marked by his attention to the visual effects of the surface, in particular, by great variations in glazing and texture. The subject matter is often secondary, a point that he calls attention to by titling the paintings with musical terms (Nocturnes) or abstract color phrases (most famously, the portrait of his mother is Arrangement in Grey and Black). The majority of his subjects are women, elements of an ongoing investigation of what constituted the concept of the \"beautiful.\" While many were commissioned portraits, Whistler also used young working class women selected for the pictorial effect, in what the eighteenth century called \"fancy pictures.\" Blue and Coral: The Little Blue Bonnet is a fancy picture from the end of Whistler's career and represents his mature style. It is the largest of his oval portraits and is one of his most finished works from this period. Whistler was an experimental artist even late in life. Many of his paintings were executed thinly, in glazes, as in The Little Bonnet. The costume is deliberately sketchy \u2014 the sitter's body and hat are depicted for their colors rather than for any accuracy of detail. Her face, on the other hand, is quite fully rendered and emerges out of the dark tones of the picture with great delicacy. This balance of the human interest of the subject and the purely abstract effects of tone and texture is the hallmark of Whistler's most successful portraits. Whistler is also represented in the museum by over 150 of his famous etchings and lithographs. View more works by Whistler in LACMA's collection.",

Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "The painting, Mount Monadnock, is one of four Thayer made late in his career of the mountain near the artist\u2019s home in New Hampshire. It represents a crucial link between modernist abstract painting and nineteenth-century landscape painting. Thayer stands at the end of a great tradition of transcendentalist landscape painting, one that begins with Thomas Cole. But he also stands as a contemporary of such figures as Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, and Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and is just as adventurous. Trained in New York and Paris, Thayer quickly made a reputation as a portrait painter. He was a central player in the development of the Society of Artists, in which Childe Hassam, William Merritt Chase, and other European-trained artists transformed the ideals of American painting at the end of the 1870s. By the end of the century, however, Thayer moved permanently to Dublin , New Hampshire , where he concentrated on two kinds of poetic subjects: portraits of women and landscapes, particularly views of Mount Monadnock . The mountain, the subject of poems by Emerson and Thoreau and an inspiration for writers as diverse as Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, and Willa Cather, was already famous, one of the great spiritual sties of the American landscape. Beginning in 1917, the artist began a monumental series of views of the subject, his last statement about his art and life. The other three are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Freer Art Gallery, and Princeton University Museum. With each painting, the trees in the foreground become clearer, the mountain side a richer purple. LACMA\u2019s painting captures the moment when the tops of the pines begin to emerge from the darkness and the air has warmed slightly, so that pockets of snow shake loose to the ground. The surface of the painting is marked by a freedom and control contained within simple, large areas of tone. The variety and range of brushstrokes can be seen in the small dabs that mark the spruce trees near the mountain\u2019s summit, the long thin white strokes of snow released from the branches of the trees, and the odd floating stroke of dark blue in the forest. Thayer arrived at this conceptual and technical freedom by two routes. The first is immediately evident in the black brushstrokes of the nearest spruce trees: Thayer studied Chinese calligraphy and has translated and naturalized it in his painting. The other is less obvious but just as important for moving Thayer beyond the stylistic limits of his Impressionist colleagues. Thayer was an ardent student of animal camouflage, particularly birds. He was particularly interested in the way in which arbitrary markings in the plumage disrupted the contours of the body so that it faded into the background. Just as he thought of animal skin as a background picture, so he tended to think of his painting surface as something natural. These two wildly different sources are typical of the unusual routes by which American artists arrived at their own version of abstraction, distinct from the work of European avant-garde artists. Celebrating the beauty of the American landscape, and uniting both an interest in Asian art and in natural science, Thayer\u2019s Mount Monadnock is a splendid addition to LACMA\u2019s diverse collections.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Wrestlers is Thomas Eakins's last completed genre painting, his last consideration of the male nude, and his last sporting picture. Considered in the trajectory of his career, from his first studies of the figure as a student and first rowing pictures completed in 1870, Wrestlers stands as a superb summation of some of the most significant themes of his career.Thomas Eakins is considered one of the two greatest Realists of American painting in the nineteenth-century; the other is Winslow Homer. While Homer concentrated on rural themes, and ultimately on the relationship of humanity to nature, Eakins painted people. Although he was a portrait painter of great psychological depth, his primary focus was the body, the human being embodied in his or her physical reality. Not surprisingly, he was a famous and important academic teacher, proselytizing the study of anatomy and the use of live models for drawing. As such, he stands as the first American artist to base his art on the close and exacting analysis of the body, and is the fountainhead for a Realist tradition which extends from him through Robert Henri and the Ashcan School, to Reginald Marsh, Fairfield Porter, and Philip Pearlstein.Upon his return to his hometown of Philadelphia in 1870, after training with Jean-Léon Gérôme at the Ecoles des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Eakins concentrated on subjects that conveyed and celebrated the character of his native city, all of them portraits but many of them showing friends and family in different activities. His goal, as the art historian Elizabeth Johns has observed, was to capture and extol the \"heroism of modern life,\" as the avant-garde Impressionists had done for French painting and culture-and to reclaim for Philadelphia a central position in the ongoing cultural life of the post-Civil War American nation. Eakins was also a teacher at his alma mater, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and introduced a new rigor into the curriculum of the oldest art school in the country. Increasingly, in both his painting and teaching, he concentrated on the male figure, finding ways to depict the male nude within a contemporary or historical context.In 1898, Eakins began a group of paintings of sporting scenes, focusing on interior sports-boxing and wrestling. Eakins began Wrestlers by having two athletes wrestle for him so that he could work out which position was most interesting. His friend, Clarence Cranmer, a journalist, asked Joseph McCann, a boxer, and another athlete, to Eakins's studio toward the end of May 1899, where Eakins photographed them in action. Having decided on the pose-\"the winning position, with a half nelson and crotch hold\" as Cranmer described it-Eakins had the two men recreate it more formally and photographed them from the angle he would use in the final work. After a first version, left unfinished, Eakins produced a small sketch for the whole composition, which has been in LACMA's collection for decades. The additions in the sketch and the final work move the painting in a new and much more complicated direction. Whereas the unfinished, early version was simply a complex study of bodies in motion, in the final version the painting becomes as well a statement about how one learns to make art, an exposition of Eakins's philosophy as a teacher and artist.In the left background is a figure of an athlete exercising, seated at a rowing machine, getting in shape for the contest to come; in the right are a coach and student. Basically all we see of them are their legs and the coach's right hand as he points to the pose the two wrestlers have taken. Perhaps Eakins is saying that learning to wrestle is a matter of getting the body in shape and the mind instructed. Mind and body must work together. Beside the coach's hand, prominently inscribed on the wall, are Eakins's signature and the date: Eakins underscores the connection between the work he has made and the scene depicted, between the artist and the coach. Both are elucidating the process by which a student learns his craft. As an artist, then, the heart of what one must learn is how to depict the human body in action, how to be an anatomist and an artist together.Such a philosophy puts Eakins more squarely in the academic tradition than any other major American artist. In some senses, then, the painting is deeply conservative. But its essential modernity is announced in subtle ways: the abrupt excision of the bodies of the coach and student by the picture frame, so that only their legs and lower torso remain; or by the peculiar space the rope on the floor charts. It is neither a straight nor angled line, nor even continuous. In the figures of the wrestlers themselves Eakins's careful contrasts of clothed and unclothed, wrinkled and taut flesh, and the angles of the arms and legs suggest the studied artificiality of how he has reconsidered what he has seen.Eakins's deep conviction that the human being is the central concern of painting, and that the human being is composed equally of mind and body, is what made him influential to his younger colleagues and later generations. Wrestlers is Eakins last completed statement on the subject, a testament to a lifetime of teaching and painting, wrestling with the dilemmas of representation and embodiment.In this vein, the painting is also very much a spiritual self-portrait of a frustrated artist toward the end of his career. Although the focus on two nude figures underscores Eakins's academic training, which extolled and elevated the human body in its most perfect state, the unusual composition suggests that Eakins intended the painting to be much more than a literal representation of a new popular bourgeois spectator entertainment. In Eakins's best and most modern late paintings, he compelled the viewer to look and think again and again about what is presented. Often the general effect for the viewer of the most probing late paintings is a feeling of discomfort. This was intentional as Eakins himself was in the midst of many personal, familial, and professional problems. The unresolved issues of Wrestlers thereby echo Eakins's own life.",

      "curator notes" : "Many artists are fond of painting their family members. There are several reasons for this. Spouses, children, and other relatives tend to be close at hand and consequently often available, and they pose for free. In the case of spouses, often there is also a romantic interest that strengthens the bond between sitter and painter. That may have been the case with the early-twentieth-century American realist George Bellows, who painted his wife numerous times throughout their marriage. In fact, it was Bellows\u0092s depiction of his wife, Emma, in the summer of 1919 that led him to focus increasingly on portraiture.In 2007, the Margaret and Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation generously gave LACMA George Bellows\u0092s Emma in the Purple Dress, the first of several large-scale, single-figure compositions that the artist painted of his wife. The painting was inspired by a typical wifely action that resulted in a not so typical husbandly response. Emma arrived home from a shopping spree excited about showing George her new purchase, a beautiful bolt of silk that she intended to sew into a skirt to match one of her favorite blouses. George was so impressed by the vivacity of the resulting ensemble that, after the skirt was finished, he quickly painted his wife wearing the new outfit. Evidence that it was a shared enthusiasm is seen in a photograph of Emma (Bellows Papers, Amherst College) holding out her skirt, pleased to be all decked out in the elaborately shirred and ruffled outfit. While Emma\u0092s mood in the photograph is lighthearted, the creation of a large canvas inspired a more somber mood. Emma is quiet and composed. But her happiness as well as George\u0092s relish in painting her is clearly expressed through the exuberant brushwork and the sheen of the fabric.Years after the painting was created, Emma noted that she did \u0093not know why he [George] called it Emma in the Purple Dress, since the skirt was rose-colored and the jacket blue.\u0094 Historians have suggested that Bellows changed the hues as a matter of artistic license. While that is also true, Bellows\u0092s ultimate choice of colors may have resulted from the artist\u0092s relationship with Hardesty Maratta, a paint supplier who also dabbled in color theory. Robert Henri, John Sloan, and other New York colleagues of Bellows avidly experimented with Maratta\u0092s ideas, especially his use of triads of complementary colors, chosen like notes of a musical scale, to establish a particular harmony and mood. Maratta\u0092s specially prepared paints encouraged a rich palette such as that seen in Emma in the Purple Dress.Emma in the Purple Dress points to a new direction in Bellows\u0092s art. His formal portraits of the 1920s reveal a new seriousness with their balanced and severely geometrical compositions and dramatic dark backgrounds, a seriousness that relates to the art of Thomas Eakins, whose 1917 retrospective at New York\u0092s Metropolitan Museum of Art greatly impressed Bellows. Like Eakins, Bellows began to focus more on the character and inner life of his sitters. The quiet intensity of Emma suggests a poignancy and a sense of the heroic and tragic. It is this mood that enabled Bellows to depart from the contemporaneity of a photograph and his earlier genre paintings to create timeless images such as Emma in the Purple Dress.",

      "curator notes" : "Millard Sheets holds several major positions in the history of American and California art. He was not only one of the leading American Scene painters of the 1930s, but later became one of the foremost teachers in the country as well as a significant organizer of exhibitions. He was also an important practitioner in the field of design.Today, Sheet's contribution to the decorative arts is most often identified with his \"Home Savings and Loan\" buildings. Beginning in 1954 and through his association with financier Howard Ahmanson, his most enthusiastic supporter, Sheets designed the buildings and decorations \u2014 mainly mosaic and painted murals, stained glass windows, and sculptures \u2014 for 40 bank branches throughout southern California. Many of these were actually studio creations; Sheets taught and then hired his students to assist in the design and creation of the modern mosaic murals, thereby encouraging the following generation of designers, artisans, and painters. However, Sheets' involvement in design began much earlier. While still a student at Chouinard School of Art in the late 1920s, he began painting murals and doing architectural designs for private clients. According to his son, Tony Sheets, Millard \"became committed early on to the concept of art in architecture \u2014 the idea of architects and artists working together f or a combined outcome \u2014 as opposed to art on architecture, where the architect places art on his already completed building as an afterthought.\" Less well documented and definitely little known and seen are his private commissions for painted murals that decorate the dining and living rooms of private homes (some of which Sheets designed himself) throughout the area. The murals were often lyrical landscapes of the rolling hills and terrain of California, and demonstrate another genre in which the artist excelled \u2014 landscape painting.Some time in either the late 1920s or early 1930s, Sheets also experimented with the folding screen format. Painted screens became quite popular during the interwar years in the United States and even Regionalists as famous as Thomas Hart Benton explored the genre. It is not known exactly why Sheets began painting screens or whether he was aware of the Russian and German Bauhaus belief that modern art could improve the life of everyday people through thoughtful design. He no doubt was familiar with the Arts and Crafts movement so strong in Southern California. Whatever his source and initial inspiration, the folding screen enabled Sheets to combine in a single work of art his two main interests \u2014 painting and the decorative arts. Later he would collect Japanese and Chinese screens.It is not known how many of folding screens Sheets actually completed, but only two are presently known and located. In both examples, Sheets presented more of a generic, idealized landscape rather than a specific scene of California, although in this example the imagery does suggest aspects of the state's rugged coastlline. Across the six panels, the shore view of rocks and sea is seen from high up, with wind-bent, leafless trees framing the view and directing the eye toward the distance, as large ferns and other plants blow in the wind. Swirling lines of the water near the beach and the bold outlines of rocks and plants create an incessant feeling of movement. The colors are strong but limited in number. The screen shares formal qualities that are the hallmark of Sheets' 1930s easel paintings: bold design, rich coloration, and unusual perspectives. Such bold stylized forms would reappear in Sheets' art much later, especially characterizing his postwar landscapes, and provide them a decorative feeling.The museum has a significant collection of Sheets' work, including his most famous painting, Angel's Flight, 1930 (one of the American Art Department's top ten paintings) and a related drawing for it, prints as well as examples of his war work, and popular late watercolors.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",

      "curator notes" : "The subject is Edna Smith, a professional model who posed for other paintings, at least two of them nudes. Since they did not require him to capture the personality of the model as he did in his portraits, figure studies were for Henri an opportunity to explore formal issues that interested him, especially the Maratta system of color and the compositional ideas that interested him and his circle. The color in this work is exceptionally vivid, the model\u2019s red hair and fair coloring set off by a complementary blue-green background. The brushwork is vigorous and joyous, clearly showing his dashing execution. Henri\u2019s already powerful technique had steadily increased in facility into the middle of the second decade of the century. In a painting such as this, where it is given completely free play, one can see what a dexterous and masterly craftsman Henri had become. Henri taught his students to \"work quickly. Don\u2019t stop for anything but the essential .... It\u2019s the spirit of the thing that counts\" (Henri diary, August 25, 1926, entry).Dr. Dorothea Moore, who donated Edna to the museum, was an early Los Angeles enthusiast of the painter. At one time she also owned Henri\u2019s The Dancer Resting (unlocated), which she lent to the museum for a 1921 exhibition.",

      "label" : "Although Henri encouraged his numerous students and followers to record everyday life in bustling genre scenes featuring the middle and lower classes, he preferred to paint solitary figures. Edna Smith was a professional model who posed for Henri several times. This seemingly straightforward depiction is also an example of the artist\u2019s experimentation with color. In the early 1910s Henri had become excited by several theories about color interaction, and he kept palette diaries in which he recorded his experiments. His friend Hardesty Maratta sold packaged paints prearranged in harmonized groups of rich colors. This system encouraged Henri to abandon his earlier, somber palette for bolder hues, such as the flaming red of the model\u2019s hair. Henri\u2019s portraits of 1914 and 1915 also reveal an increased contrast of lights and darks: here the deep blue-green at the left of the canvas is counterposed to the glowing white of the negligee. By the time he painted Edna, Henri had devised his own color charts. The brilliant coloration of this work clearly demonstrates his enthusiasm for modern color theory. As he told his students, \u201cColor represents the deeper strain in human life.\u201d",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "This painting regularly has been referred to as Wendt\u2019s masterpiece since first being called that in the book published in conjunction with the Stendahl Art Galleries\u2019 1926 exhibition of Wendt\u2019s work. In many respects it is entirely characteristic of Wendt\u2019s mature paintings: in its subject being the California foothills, its restrained palette, its noon light, its broad, long, regular brushstrokes, and its simplification of forms.Wendt\u2019s approach to composition was to find a motif and let it dictate the structure of the composition. His paintings generally give the impression of an intimate encounter with a modest portion of a landscape and are not formally composed. Where Nature\u2019s God Hath Wrought, in contrast, is an extremely bold and powerful composition, at once dramatic and unified. Wendt always sought the spirit of the landscape and its deeper meaning; the title of this painting is his strongest statement of that philosophy. Many have remarked on the inspirational quality of the mountain\u2019s upward thrust. According to critic Arthur Millier, the view is of Morro Bay, north of San Luis Obispo in central California, where Wendt occasionally worked in the 1920s. As Millier noted, the bay\u2019s distinctive soaring hill formations afforded Wendt a \"supreme opportunity to express his profound feeling for the structural balance.\"The last digit of the date Wendt inscribed on the canvas is ambiguous. In recent literature the date given has been 1923, but exhibition and literature references suggest that the artist painted Where Nature\u2019s God Hath Wrought in 1925 or shortly before. The first record of the painting is its inclusion in the Los Angeles Museum\u2019s First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings of 1925-26. It is doubtful that Wendt would have contributed a painting several years old to such a significant exhibition. Furthermore, the fact that the canvas is unusually large for Wendt might be explained by its function as a major showpiece.The painting shared, with the modernist Parthenope by JOHN CARROLL (LACMA; q.v.), the Balch Prize in the Pan-American Exhibition, achieving for the artist considerable local distinction. It was the one exception to the awards jury\u2019s preference for progressive styles. This may be explained, in part, by a deference to Wendt\u2019s preeminence among Los Angeles artists. At the same time, however, the painting\u2019s breadth and simplified, somewhat geometric forms would have appealed to the taste of the jurors.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1911 Bellows began to summer in Maine. During his visits there, until 1916, he moved increasingly away from the almost exclusively urban subject matter of his early career and turned toward landscape painting. The Coming Storm was painted during June 1916, when Bellows and his family were summering in remote Camden, Maine, with LEON KROLL. Early in their stay they were visited almost daily with storms, and Bellows\u2019s paintings from June and July are among his most dramatic in their contrast and energetic brushwork. By this time he was systematically using the Maratta palette, and The Coming Storm is fairly strong in color despite its overcast tonality. In his record book the artist indicated the color scheme for his painting as follows: Yellow-Green 13.9.5.3.1, Yellow 11-7, Green 11, Green-Blue 9.1, Blue-Purple 9, Orange-Yellow 1, Red-Purple 5, Red-Orange 5 [colors indicated by initials in original] The numbers by each of the abbreviations of color names refer to the value of the hue that Bellows used. This system of assigning numbers to color values was established at a meeting in 1915 at which Bellows, Maratta, and others were present and which resulted in a chart of colors and values. It was one of several elaborations of the Maratta color system worked out in Henri\u2019s circle.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "Sidney Plains is an area in south-central New York State, between Binghamton and Oneonta, that Cropsey visited frequently on his trips to Niagara Falls and the Susquehanna River Valley. In the middle ground, at the extreme right, just below the hill with the white farmhouse flows the Unadilla River. A pencil drawing dated 1873 locates the exact spot Cropsey chose to delineate. In fact, the painting deviates little from the preparatory drawing and consequently takes on the character of a topographical record. It was just such numerous details presented on a large scale that critics such as Henry James found fault with when the painting was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in 1875.During the eleven years following his return from England in 1863, Cropsey added to his growing reputation with a number of largescale, panoramic landscapes of northeastern American scenery. In Sidney Plains, as in the earlier Valley of Wyoming, 1865 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), he attempted to epitomize the settling of the wilderness. Cropsey depicted man\u2019s encroaching on the wild landscape as he fenced in orchards and grazing fields for cows and sheep. Such expansion was then seen as \"progress\" and was associated with the advancement of modern technology, here indicated by the presence of telegraph poles and a distant train. The completion of the Erie Railroad line to Binghamton through the Alleghenies in 1848 had made the area more accessible to New York City.Cropsey\u2019s landscape represents a nostalgic image of the settling of the American frontier. The railroad was crucial to the settlement of the American wilderness and in this painting may have had more than iconographic significance. Cropsey may have painted Sidney Plains for the railroad magnate John Taylor Johnston. There is conflicting information concerning the name of the original owner: when the landscape was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1875, the owner was listed as John H. Johnston, and literature thereafter referred to the owner as John N. Johnston or John J. Johnston. John T. Johnston was a collector of American painting and the first president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If he were the owner, Sidney Plains was not sold in 1876 when business circumstances forced him to sell much of his collection. John T. Johnston may have kept the painting or given it to his son, John Herbert Johnston, owner of the Tenth Street Studio Building, where many New York artists rented studios. Although John Taylor Johnston did not own the Erie Railroad pictured in Cropsey\u2019s landscape, his Lehigh and Susquehanna line provided one of the links from the seaboard to the inland. Sidney Plains is painted in Cropsey\u2019s characteristic autumnal palette, which, according to the color notes written on the preparatory drawing, he found in nature. The sun breaking through the moist haze has the appearance of shafts of light. Although they can be explained as a natural phenomenon, these pearly hued rays imply a divine blessing on the land and its settlement.",

      "curator notes" : "In the autumn of 1872 Keith made the acquaintance of John Muir when he explored the hills beyond Yosemite with the naturalist. Yosemite Valley was a product of a later trip in 1875. A dramatic, composed image, it was painted in the artist\u2019s studio specifically as an exhibition piece. It portrays a commanding view of Cathedral Rocks, which are in the valley along a bend in the Merced River. Nothing obstructs the panoramic view. A bit of the river bank is included as a repoussoir to lead the viewer into the scene. The towering trees are arranged on the sides to permit an open vista of the cliffs. The addition of the riders, while suggesting a narrative, was also essential to the composition. Even the pile of dead tree trunks in the center of the painting was arranged so that the large logs would link the two sides of the painting. Keith created many such epic paintings during the period between his two European trips, and many of these were criticized as too artificial. Although the general appearance of this version might give the impression of a standard picturesque composition, Keith avoided the tight, linear painting style associated with the Düsseldorf school. He also escaped the pervasive grays of such German landscapes by infusing the background of Yosemite Valley with an array of soft, opalescent hues.",

He first visited the area in 1868 but frequently returned to the Sierras, sometimes with the naturalist John Muir (founder of the Sierra Club in 1892) and landscape photographer Carleton Watkins. This grand-scale panorama is in Keith\u2019s early style, reflecting elements of Hudson River-school romanticism as well as the tight, linear, realist style of the Dusseldorf Academy in Germany, where Keith trained. The site is easily identifiable as a view of Cathedral Rock along a bend in the Merced River. Keith dramatized the scene through lighting, shrouding the grand cliffs in soft, opalescent hues, much as Albert Bierstadt did in his sublime vistas of the Sierras. Yosemite had been established as a nature preserve by President Lincoln in 1864. In the postwar era it became one of the West\u2019s most popular tourist attractions, luring hardy folk such as the two horseback riders here. Yosemite\u2019s unique geological formations, conveyed through paintings such as this one, captured the imagination of Americans.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "In his address given at the memorial for Sanford Gifford, Worthington Whittredge said that no autumn came that Gifford did not visit his mother in the town of Hudson and the nearby Catskills. He loved the mountains and painted them more than any other subject. The motif of this painting is the Kaaterskill, or Kauterskill, Clove, a scenic gorge of the small Kaaterskill Creek that extends about five miles between Haines Falls village and Palenville. It was a theme for numerous Hudson River school artists, and Gifford sketched there as early as 1845 and exhibited a painting of the clove. From this direct study, possibly together with others, he completed both the wellknown Kauterskill Clove, 1862 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the museum\u2019s painting October in the Catskills, eighteen years later. The artist was known for repeating favorite subjects with slight refinements. The true subject of the painting is the lighted atmosphere that fills a great natural bowl, as in some of his other paintings. \"With Mr. Gifford, landscape, painting is air-painting,\" wrote George Sheldon in 1879 (American Painters [New York: D. Appleton], p. 17). By sacrificing distant detail to the palpable, shimmering atmosphere, as in the museum\u2019s painting, Gifford achieved a poetic interpretation of impressions that the motif and nature in general had made on him. In this spirit he freely arranged and modified elements in his finished paintings, which were studio creations. A comparison with the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Kauterskill Clove shows how Gifford marshaled his materials in October in the Catskills for an entirely different effect and feeling. The vantage point is higher, eliminating the view of the lake but increasing awareness of the plain and mountains stretching into the distance. The artist has also moved the trees and rocks on the left from the near foreground to the immediate foreground. The combined effect of these changes is to substitute, for the gentle progression into the distance in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s painting, a dramatic leap from a bulky, immediate foreground almost directly into the uninhabited far distance. This was a device often used by ALBERT BIERSTADT to enhance an impression of overwhelming distance. Also different is the quality of light in the two paintings. Kauterskill Clove is bathed in a delicate combination of yellows and blues, whereas the light in October in the Catskills is described by much hotter yellows and reds, emanating from a visible sun that seems to ignite the foreground foliage. Gifford has rearranged the ridges of the clove in a more regular arrangement that seems to center upon the sun. The sun is a potent force in the painting, appearing to dissolve the distant mountains into something like the vortices that swirl within the landscapes of J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851). The distance is defined entirely in terms of the action of the sun, reflecting in the waterfall and tiny distant houses. The overall impression is that of a powerful force in a vast primeval wilderness. A very similar painting of the same subject, dimensions, and date, but with the foreground rocks and trees reversed on the right side of the canvas, appeared on the art market in New York (see Related Works). It cannot be determined whether the provenance and early citations in the 1881 Memorial Catalogue refer to the museum\u2019s painting or this other one.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997During the mid-19th century light became a transcendent force in the American imagination. Sanford Gifford and other painters transformed a basically realist Hudson River school-style of landscape painting into a more romantic idiom. Nature and the spiritual world became one, as a soft, almost palpable atmosphere pervaded their scenes. In October in the Catskills, Gifford presents a dramatic view from a cliff near the town of Hudson in upstate New York, where his mother lived. Although the East was well populated by 1880, Gifford chose to depict a locale devoid of human presence. Yet he did not present the wilderness as a forbidding experience, but as one of awesome grandeur. The blinding sun casts the entire scene in beautiful golds and oranges and draws the viewer\u2019s attention to the center of the painting. Here the distant mountains are enveloped in haze. This wilderness is not the unknown frontier, far away in the West, but a spiritual ground where mankind can quietly commune with God.The frame dates from the 1870s, when a growing elegance in framemaking reflected the increasing postwar cosmopolitanism of upper class Americans. The popular cove profile of earlier frames has been deepened and decorated with a dense, continuous pattern of acanthus leaves. Bronze was added to the gilding in the 1980s to approximate the warm tones of the painting.",

      "curator notes" : "As a guest in 1871 of the official government survey team led by Ferdinand Hayden, Moran explored the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and became the first professional artist to paint the area. While he was out in the field, Moran worked in pencil and watercolor. These watercolor field sketches were used to influence Congress in its decision to declare the Yellowstone area America\u2019s first national park.On his return to Philadelphia at the end of the summer of 1871 Moran produced a series of highly finished watercolors, which became his best-known early images of the Yellowstone. Contemporaneously dated oil paintings of Yellowstone by Moran are rare, and only three from 1872 have been documented: the museum\u2019s painting, an unlocated The Tower Falls, and The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The last is perhaps Moran\u2019s best known, having been bought by Congress soon after its exhibition in Washington in 1872.Hot Springs of the Yellowstone was only recently discovered and did not receive critical attention in either the nineteenth or twentieth century. The exact month in which Moran painted it is not known; it may have been created before or after The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.Moran depicted the main terrace of Mammoth Hot Springs in the Wyoming Territory, just south of what is today the Wyoming-Montana state line. The Hayden group spent three days in late July 1871 exploring the springs, and Moran\u2019s watercolors express their enthusiasm for the unusual geology of the area. Hayden noted, \"The scenery in the vicinity of these hot springs is varied and beautiful beyond description\" (\"The Wonders of the West-II,\" Scribner\u2019s Monthly 3 [February 1872]: 391).In the meticulously rendered foreground details Moran showed the hot springs and unusual travertine terraces, geological formations which were not well known in the East. Hot springs tend to be concentrated along drainage basins of lakes and streams, and Moran\u2019s delineation of a lake in the broad plain of the middle distance is faithful to geological principles. The streams that feed into the lake eat away at the rock as the water, rich in minerals, filters through limestone crevices. Even his dabbing style of brushwork mirrors the cauliflowerlike appearance of sulfur deposits.The entire scene is conveyed in the vibrant palette typical of Moran\u2019s watercolors: salmon, yellow, sulphur, onyx, and a bit of green. The intense hues, although seemingly exaggerated, realistically present the extraordinary colors that the rocks take on from the sulfur, sodium, and other minerals in the water.When he originally transcribed this view of the hot springs, Moran was looking south toward what is now known as Bunsen Peak, which rises near the Gardiner River. Although the high mountain visible in the distance can be identified as Bunsen Peak, Moran took liberties with its profile. The entire distant area, with its soft opalescent atmosphere and rainbow, is idealized. The romanticized view suggests that Moran intended the painting to be an exhibition piece rather than a highly developed preparatory study.In many respects Hot Springs of the Yellowstone reflects the influence of Turner. In his early paintings the English artist had demonstrated an exactitude to nature which John Ruskin had extolled while in his later canvases he evinced a romanticism in his use of a brilliant palette and powerful sense of vortex. Moran\u2019s landscape has all these elements.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",
      "curator notes" : "Lauritz painted a wide variety of landscape themes, including dramatic Alaskan snow scenes and coastal views but received the most acclaim for his paintings of the desert. He made his first trip to the desert in 1920 and often camped near Palm Springs and the Salton Sea. In his characteristic desert paintings Lauritz sought to capture the effect of bright light. These fairly tonal paintings convey a certain stillness and peace. In Desert Landscape he contrasts the quiet of the desert with the drama of a mountain storm. As do all his paintings, Desert Landscape displays the simple and broad technique Lauritz achieved using exceptionally large brushes.This painting and a canvas of identical size depicting the Pico House, n.d. (LACMNH), hung for years in the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. The hotel, which opened in 1927, was designed by Charles Whittlesey in the rococo Spanish Colonial revival style popular in the 1920s.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "This charming painting of a boy with his stuffed rabbit is a portrait of Preston Carter Harrison (born about 1921), son of Mr. and Mrs. William Preston Harrison. No doubt Preston Harrison chose Frieseke to paint the portrait on the advice of his artist-friends; indeed, Harrison records in a letter dated June 5, 1926, that Ernest Lawson (1873-1939) thought Frieseke the \"greatest of all to paint youngsters.\" This sentiment was expressed to Harrison when the collector visited New York on his way to France. Frieseke painted the portrait a few weeks later at his summer home in Le-Mesnil-sur-Blangy. The Harrisons arrived there in late July, and by August 12 Harrison could write to Louise Upton at the museum that the portrait was completed.Harrison was quite satisfied with the finished painting, considering it not only a typical Frieseke but a painting worthy of being in the museum. It combined the best of Frieseke\u2019s talents, being a figure painting to which natural light is essential. Young Carter sits politely on the edge of an elegant French chair, obviously posing for the artist and oblivious to the sunlight filtering into the room through the windows and door. The sun\u2019s intense rays contrast with the soft interior light. The pastel palette used to describe the scene is unlike that of most late works by Frieseke, which are delicate but usually darker. In fact, although Frieseke completed the painting, it appears almost unfinished. Despite the delicate effect, the painting has a strong structure organized by the lines of the room and the placement of the furniture. The variety of decorative patterns within the composition do not confuse the legibility of the scene, and, in fact, the patterned objects -- upholstered chair, oriental rug, and garden flowers in the distance -- form a contrast with the figure of the quiet boy. Harrison entitled the painting Youth rather than identifying it as a portrait of his son to avoid the type of criticism that the portrait of Mrs. Harrison by ROBERT HENRI, 1925 (LACMA; q.v.), had received.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "This painting is considered among Cassatt\u2019s earliest, if not her first, treatment of her popular mother and child image. According to Achille Segard, the painting was exhibited during April 1880 in the Fifth Impressionist Exhibition. Although none of Cassatt\u2019s contributions is enumerated in the catalogue, she is known to have shown eight paintings. If Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child was included, then the customary explanation of Cassatt\u2019s use of this theme, i.e., that she began painting the subject after spending much time with her nieces and nephews during her brother Alexander\u2019s visit to France in the summer of 1880, is incorrect. Whatever her initial motivation, Cassatt would devote nearly one third of her artistic production to such themes, as did many artists of the period. Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child is an example of Cassatt\u2019s work as an impressionist, shortly before her mature, more solid style began to emerge. In the 1870s, no doubt inspired by Degas and other French impressionists, Cassatt began depicting intimate domestic scenes, often of figures in interiors. In this painting a woman tenderly washes her child. The image is cropped on both sides --a favorite device of Degas, who borrowed it from contemporary photographs and Japanese prints -- and the entire scene is slightly tilted up and compressed into the narrow foreground. The stripes of the chair\u2019s upholstery and the wallpaper intensify this verticality. While the Japanese qualities of Cassatt\u2019s art are usually considered in terms of her later paintings and prints, she actually assimilated the oriental aesthetic quite early. Already apparent in Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child are the use of an intimate subject and a skillfully balanced surface design incorporating areas of patterning, both encouraged by the example of Japanese prints. Historians have often commented on the pose of the child, especially the position of his legs, finding sources in Madonna and Child images by Parmigianino (1503-1540) and Antonio Correggio (1494-1534). Although Cassatt knew of Italian religious painting and late nineteenth-century artists tended to dress biblical persons in contemporary attire, such historical sources are not necessary to explain the pose. Such awkward naturalism is quite typical of works by her mentor, Degas, and demonstrates how Cassatt utilized every aspect of the scene to convey the modernity, the untraditional representation, of the image. The overall surface is quite sketchy, as Cassatt vigorously brushed out contour lines with thick pigment to convey a sense of the momentary. Nevertheless, the form is not lost, as demonstrated by the mother\u2019s superbly delineated right hand. In the 1870s, influenced by the impressionists, Cassatt began to lighten and brighten her palette. In her work she reflects the impressionist fascination with the color white. Although the palette used here is lighter than that of her previous paintings, it still exhibits an intense hue, as Cassatt explored the reflection of the blue and green of the setting and the flesh tones on the white attire of the figures and the interaction of all the colors. The delicate tints and brushwork are combined to create a shimmering surface. The painting was bought by Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Atmore Pope, Americans whom Cassatt met in Naugatuck, Connecticut, in 1898-99 during her first trip home since the Franco-Prussian War. Pope had amassed a fortune in the steel industry, and by the time of his introduction to Cassatt had already begun to collect impressionist paintings, which now constitute the collection of the Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Connecticut. The Popes\u2019 daughter, Theodate, became Cassatt\u2019s most intimate young friend.",

      "curator notes" : "In 1953 the motion-picture company Norma Productions hired Benton to execute a painting to be used for publicity purposes for the movie The Kentuckian, starring Burt Lancaster. Lancaster and Harold Hecht, producers of the motion picture, admired Benton\u2019s art, and it was upon their initiative that Benton received the commission. Except for its showing at the movie\u2019s premiere in Washington, D.C., the canvas was never exhibited until its donation to the museum. It was, however, reproduced on labels for bottles of Beam\u2019s Choice whiskey.As early as the 1910s Benton had painted portraits and historical pieces for the budding motion-picture industry, which was then based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 1937 Benton was sent by Life magazine to paint Hollywood, 1937 (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Mo.), perhaps his best-known work related to the industry. He visited the movie capital many times over the next decades and was often commissioned by the studios to create works used as advertisements, such as lithographs for The Grapes of Wrath and a painting for The Long Voyage Home. In 1946 he came to Hollywood to work with Walt Disney.To capture the essence of The Kentuckian, Benton read the script and in the autumn of 1953 spent several days on location in Rockport, Indiana, watching the filming. The movie features a backwoodsman and his son who confront civilization in the form of a frontier village. Benton chose to epitomize the movie\u2019s theme with the image of the backwoodsman, Big Eli Wakesfield, played by Burt Lancaster, and his son Little Eli, played by Donald MacDonald, just before they see the town for the first time.The American West and the progress of civilization were of special interest to Benton, who had portrayed these themes in his early murals. In this painting the Kentuckian becomes the archetypal frontiersman leading his family to the golden land in the West. The Kentuckian heads toward the unseen village, located somewhere ahead in a sunny valley. He strides forward, high on a hill against a cloudfilled sky. This baroque compositional device, echoed by the diagonal positions of the boy and the dog, emphasizes the Kentuckian\u2019s dynamic vitality. Although the painting\u2019s large size may have been determined by the commission, the heroic presentation was surely Benton\u2019s idea, for many of his late easel paintings are more tightly focused around a single large figure than were his early mural scenes. Also typical of Benton\u2019s later paintings is his portrayal of the forms in strong colors with crisp outlines and an undulating plasticity.Benton\u2019s methodical working procedure was always laborious, and for The Kentuckian he created numerous drawings, including a cubist, diagrammatic study; preparatory oils; and a clay model of the boy\u2019s figure. The full-length composition was painted in Benton\u2019s Kansas City studio.",

      "curator notes" : "Carl Sadakichi Hartmann (1867-1944) was one of the most astute art historians and critics of the early twentieth century, best remembered for his History of American Art (1901) and perceptive reviews and essays on photography published in Camera Work Always ahead of his times, he edited and published two of the earliest avant-garde magazines in America, wrote reviews for newspapers (often using the pseudonym Sidney Allen), and was instrumental in bringing the symbolist movement to the attention of people in the United States.An eccentric character, Hartmann was involved in such unusual ventures as the production of the first perfume concert in New York in 1902. He spent his most creative years in New York but due to asthma moved to California in the early 1920s. His health continued to deteriorate, worsened by the effects of alcohol. He became involved in the Hollywood circle of actors around John Barrymore and more importantly in the group of artists centered around the home of Margery Winter. Among the artists he met there was Ejnar Hansen, with whom he formed a long and close friendship.Hartmann thoroughly enjoyed posing for artists and during his life was painted and photographed by numerous American and foreign artists. Hansen drew, painted, and sculpted Hartmann many times. This painting is probably his best-known portrait of Hartmann. Hansen was exceptionally perceptive in conveying old age, and in all of his portraits of Hartmann the artist did not balk at making an honest portrayal. Hansen clearly depicted how greatly ill health and dissipation had aged Hartmann. Yet Hansen was also very sympathetic to the man whom many in Los Angeles considered a mere caricature of what he had been. Hansen continued to convey Hartmann\u2019s intelligence, even entitling one of his portraits The Old Philosopher, 1940 (estate of the artist as of 1965). In the museum\u2019s portrait Hartmann thoughtfully sits next to a table full of books, as if he has paused to contemplate what he has just read. With his hand to his head, Hartmann appears in the traditional pose of the thinker. The soft light filtering through the interior and the delicate browns, grays, and oranges create a protective, mellow atmosphere around the tired Hartmann.This portrait won the Foundation of Western Art\u2019s first prize for the best painting of 1934. Generally considered to be one of Hansen\u2019s masterpieces, it demonstrates his conservative interpretation of Cézannesque form, composition, and brushwork.",

      "about the era" : "Although the thirteen colonies that would constitute the United States of America were founded by several different nations, by 1763 (the end of the French and Indian Wars), the British controlled most of North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",
      "curator notes" : "When this painting was first exhibited and in early lists of West\u2019s works, the subject was given as Rinaldo and Armida, from a scene in Torquato Tasso\u2019s Gerusalemme Liberata (1575), in which Rinaldo is most often represented holding a mirror to Armida\u2019s face, as in West\u2019s version of 1766 (Rutgers University Art Gallery, New Brunswick, NJ.). Few details of the painting support that identification, however, whereas many coincide with the story of Cymon and Iphigenia, which West may have known either from the original tale by Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353) or from the version by John Dryden (1700). Cymon was the handsome son of a nobleman of Cypress who was so crude and stupid that he was sent to work on the land. One morning he happened on the camp where Iphigenia (not the daughter of Agamemnon) was sleeping among her slaves. Transfixed by her beauty, he remained leaning on his staff. When she awoke and spoke, he continued to stare at her. His love for Iphigenia fired Cymon with such desire for learning that he quickly advanced to become an exemplary young man and after some military adventures, won her. All the elements in this painting correspond to the story, with the exception that Iphigenia is here clothed, whereas in most representations she is sleeping nearly nude, with her breasts uncovered. A reference to this detail is made by the partial dress of the sleeping slave on the right. The museum\u2019s picture and West\u2019s Isaac\u2019s Servant Tying the Bracelet on Rebecca\u2019s Arm, 1775 (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Conn.), dated two years later and of identical size, were painted for John Hobart, the second earl of Buckinghamshire, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776. The theme shared by these otherwise dissimilar subjects is the finding of the ideal wife. It would have been entirely characteristic of West to have painted these pictures, with their similar central female figures, as allegorical portraits, in this case of Lord Buckinghamshire\u2019s second wife, whom he had married in 1770. The fact that they were inherited by the daughter from this marriage would seem to support this conjecture. If Iphigenia is a portrait of the countess, perhaps this explains her modestly covered bosom. In his well-known works of the mid-1760s West continued to develop his somewhat dry and stiff neoclassical style. By the early 1770s he had arrived at a truly grand style: the forms are simpler and larger, colors richer, technique more expert and elegant. The large forms, heavy drapery, and slow rhythms recall the classicism of the Italian seventeenth-century artists Guercino (1591-1666) and Guido Reni (1575-1642).",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "This example of Steele\u2019s mature style is characteristic of his interest in expressing the simple beauty of the hills and fields of Indiana while applying impressionist techniques toward the development of a distinctly American school of art. Its free paint handling and informal composition contribute to the sense that it is a fresh transcription of nature. The site is reminiscent of the Salt Creek and nearby smaller Schooner Creek valleys that lie at the foot of the high, wooded crest where Steele\u2019s House of the Singing Winds was located.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Cynthia Brown was a favorite model of both Moses and Raphael Soyer, posing often for them for more than twenty years. During this time she matured under the artists\u2019 eyes, as is demonstrated by the museum\u2019s two paintings of her by Moses, created years apart. In this painting Cynthia is young, her angular face full. Moses no doubt painted her so often because she epitomized the type of woman to whom he was attracted. He even married such a woman, describing his wife, Ida Chassner (d. 1970), as \"tall, angular, . . . with wide-apart blue eyes, curly hair, and high cheekbones.\"While Soyer usually portrayed his figures dressed, he occasionally painted full and partially draped nudes. In this painting Cynthia covers her breasts with her hands. The modesty of the gesture accentuates her vulnerability. The artist\u2019s portrayal of this wide-eyed, doleful woman is very poignant.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Ritman shared with other American impressionists who worked at Giverny a fondness for intimate boudoir and parlor scenes. Such images were used by FREDERICK CARL FRIESEKE and Ritman for the exploration of formal concerns, such as the action of sunlight in an interior. In Mademoiselle Gaby the young woman is at rest, holding a bunch of flowers that she has just picked. The woman\u2019s static pose, like that of an odalisque, is countered by the movement of the decorative patterns of her dress and the curtains and by the flickering of the broken, impressionist brushwork. In the early 1920s Ritman\u2019s palette deepened, as is evidenced by the warm red and blue of this paintinEarly on during his residence at Giverny Ritman persuaded a young model now known only by her first name, Gabriel, to live with him. She served as the figure for many of his paintings and can even be seen wearing the same broad-brimmed hat that is in the museum\u2019s painting in At the Table (unlocated, illustrated International Studio 67 [April 1919]: LXII). Because Gaby was painted so often and Ritman created at least one other very similar interior scene, the exhibition records of Mademoiselle Gaby are difficult to verify. This painting may have been exhibited under the title Gaby at Macbeth Gallery in 1919 and during the next few years at the Paris Salon (1920), the Art Institute of Chicago (1920), and the Milch Galleries (1924).",

      "curator notes" : "Elizabeth Alexander (1867-1947) was the daughter of James W. Alexander, who was introduced to John White Alexander by Joseph Harper because of the similarity of their names. Elizabeth and John were married in 1887, and the following year their only child, James, was born. Elizabeth was an educated, attractive woman who enjoyed the company of her husband\u2019s circle of painters and writers. This portrait of her was painted in Alexander\u2019s New York studio late in 1902 and immediately included in his exhibition at Durand-Ruel\u2019s galleries held in late November. It was one of the favorites of the exhibition, commended for its subdued color, flowing line, and grace. The portrait demonstrates Alexander\u2019s mature style as it developed from his symbolist days in Paris. It is an evocative figure study in which mood and atmosphere take precedence over frank likeness. The portrait was painted in a palette of muted pinks and moss green -- the artist\u2019s favorite colors -- on a coarse, loosely woven, absorbent canvas to produce a soft, hazy effect. Alexander cast his wife in a somewhat ambiguous, shadowy outdoor setting with dramatic spotlighting on her face and right hand. The strong light shining from below, which first appeared in Alexander\u2019s early theatrical portraits of the 1880s, reappeared in his paintings of the late 1890s. Such lighting seems quite appropriate for a portrait of Elizabeth Alexander, for she not only shared her husband\u2019s interest in the theater, she also collaborated closely with him on costume and lighting designs and, after his death , made a distinguished career in the theatrical arts. The shadowy illumination heightens the quiet sense of mystery which pervades the best of Alexander\u2019s mature figure paintings. Despite her quite independent nature -- in the 1910s she became active in the women\u2019s suffrage movement -- Mrs. Alexander was portrayed by her husband as a fragile beauty. Her billowing gown forms a gentle flowing line, echoing the curves of her hat and the shadowy trees and clouds in the background. Alexander was deeply interested in late nineteenth-century theories regarding the psychology of line, and in the 1890s he began to compose paintings of elegant women in terms of sensuous, curving shapes. His fascination with emotive line caused Alexander to become increasingly bold, and by the early twentieth century he was creating paintings in which the figures and their dresses form daringly abstract compositions of exaggerated line and flat patterns. Elizabeth Alexander often posed for her husband; between 1893 and 1902 he painted at least five portraits of her. This is one of the largest compositions identified as her portrait. Its size, as well as the full length of the figure and the presence of a balustrade -- a traditional motif of eighteenth-century portraits set in gardens -- places the painting within the grandmanner portrait tradition. When the painting was first publicly displayed, critics commented on its English landscape setting and Mrs. Alexander\u2019s old fashioned gown, noting that it recalled the work of Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788). After the artist\u2019s death the portrait was included in numerous memorial exhibitions, usually with the title On a Balcony. By 1939 when it was included in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, the painting had become confused with another full-length portrait of Mrs. Alexander, one dated 1894 and sometimes referred to as Changeable Taffeta (estate of the artist as of 1985). Consequently much of the subsequent literature on Alexander has included a date much too early for this painting and also incorrect exhibition and literature documentation.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Few paintings from Turner\u2019s Munich period are known. Turner\u2019s mentor in Europe, Currier, was the most active still-life painter among the Americans in Munich and may have inspired Turner to attempt to work in that genre. Turner sent two still-life paintings from Munich to the Society of American Artists\u2019 annual in 1880. Of those known today, closest to the museum\u2019s paintings is Still Life with Swords, 1880 (with Child\u2019s Gallery, Boston), which bears the inscription \"Munich 80.\" Although more finished, it shares the warm background and extremely oblong format of Hollyhocks and its concentration of incident at one end of the painting. In an article on composition in 1896 (The Art Interchange 36 [February 1896]: 34) Turner praised oriental art, and Japanese motifs had appeared in his work by the mid-1880s. Although a consciousness of Japanese design is not generally associated with Munich in the 1870s, Hollyhocks\u2019 narrow, vertical format and flat, decorative arrangement of leaves and flowers against a lighter, somewhat golden background suggest that Turner was already aware of Japanese art and decorative concerns. The unfinish of the roughed-in lower half of the canvas also anticipates the tendency to simplification and reduction, which is seen-and was commented upon-in Turner\u2019s later still, life compositions. However, decorative, vertical still-life paintings with light backgrounds by the Austrian artist Hans Makart (1840-1884) are known. One of the outstanding students of the Munich academy in the 1860s, Makart continued to exert a strong influence on decorative painting in Munich even after his removal to Vienna.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "In May 1863 Bierstadt and the writer Fitz Hugh Ludlow left New York for the artist\u2019s second trip through the West. Their principal objective was to capture the beauty of Yosemite Valley, which the photographs of Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) had revealed to astonished New Yorkers in 1862.In a drawing room in San Francisco in August, on the eve of their departure for the final leg of their journey there, they again gazed at Watkins\u2019s photographs. Shortly before reaching Yosemite, they and other artist-companions -- Enoch Wood Perry (1831-1915) and Virgil Williams (1830-1886) of San Francisco -- paused near Mariposa to sketch the big trees. Although the museum\u2019s painting was not executed until about ten years later, it should not be surprising that in it Bierstadt borrowed the subject and vantage point of one of Watkins\u2019s early photographs of the Grizzly Giant Sequoia.The size of the museum\u2019s painting indicates that it was not one of the oil sketches Bierstadt made that day. All of his sketches from that trip were fourteen by nineteen inches or smaller. Bierstadt did not employ the twenty-two-by-thirty-inch sheet until 1872, and then only for oil sketches painted in the studio.The museum\u2019s painting probably dates from Bierstadt\u2019s residence in San Francisco (1871-73). It may be visible in a photograph probably taken in 1873 of the artist\u2019s studio, where it hangs on the wall among rows of studio sketches (Hendricks, Bierstadt, CL-6).Bierstadt often painted the big California trees. He exhibited such paintings in 1874 at the National Academy of Design and the Royal Academy. The Grizzly Giant still stands in Mariposa Grove. The huge tree, to the left of center in the painting, was 28 feet wide and 209 feet high. Equally impressive was the giant\u2019s age, estimated at twenty-five hundred years, a span of time going back to the kings of the Old Testament.Bierstadt may have used the museum\u2019s painting as a study for his ten-foot-high California Redwoods, painted in about 1875 (private collection). In that painting he corrected the Grizzly Giant\u2019s leaning, noticeable in the oil study. Intended as a record for the artist\u2019s later use, these studies have a fresh realism often sacrificed to dramatic effect in the finished exhibition paintings.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "The inscription on the reverse indicates that this is a self-portrait. It does appear to be a self, portrait to judge from the similarity of the likeness to the portrait of the artist by CHARLES LORING ELLIOTT, C. 1845, in the collection of the National Academy of Design. Its strong lighting and somewhat photographic quality are characteristic of a new degree of realism that was transforming Spencer's formerly romantic manner at this point in his career and was to dominate his future work, as indeed it would that of Elliott's. On the other hand, Spencer's portrait of himself is more flattering than his likeness by Elliott. The self-portrait's hard, direct gaze is encountered in numerous other portraits by Spencer. Spencer's wife, who remained in New York City rather than move with her husband to upstate New York in 1858, later charged him with insanity. His letters do not appear to support this charge.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Sloan\u2019s decision to work in Gloucester, a popular spot among artists, arose from his desire for new and different material, and the paintings he executed there represent a departure from the subject matter and style of his earlier and better-known paintings in several respects. The impact of postimpressionist and School of Paris paintings exhibited in the Armory Show of 1913 challenged him to modify his approach to painting. Prior to this time he had waited to encounter an interesting subject and then painted it from memory in his studio; now he recognized the validity of landscapes and of more randomly chosen motifs, as well as the need to paint on a regular basis.During his five summers in Gloucester Sloan painted approximately three hundred pictures, most of them done on his portable easel. These outdoor scenes were painted quickly and directly, with very few sketches. Seeing the limitations of his formerly low-key palette, Sloan now employed a much greater variety of color, using for each painting a different, set palette, limited according to the scheme of color advocated by the color theorist and paint supplier Hardesty Maratta. In Town Steps and other works Sloan also explored the theories of architectonic structure advocated by Maratta and others, developing a firm geometry and long diagonals, while also tilting up his backgrounds to better balance surface design with perspective recession. In this painting Sloan displays a new vigor of paint application and interest in painting textures, inspired by his having seen paintings by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890).According to Sloan the figures in Town Steps were anonymous pedestrians, typical citizens of Gloucester. As is characteristic of his paintings of the area, it is a landscape with figures rather than a genre subject, as were his New York paintings. The original title, The Town Steps, is misleading because of the definite article. There were several sets of stairs between the streets of Gloucester, none singled out as \"the\" town steps.Years later, after looking at a reproduction of the painting, Sloan commented, \"Thoroughly satisfactory is my memory of this painting refreshed by the photograph. These wooden steps were a pedestrian thoroughfare connecting streets on two levels. The girls are healthy types of the native population. Rich in color and convincing in light. I\u2019d like to see it again.\"",

      "curator notes" : "Born in Wisconsin in 1887 and schooled in Wisconsin, Chicago, and New York, O\u2019Keeffe went on to become one of the foremost artists of the first generation of American modernists as well as the first significant woman artist in 20th-century United States.The painting is an example of her initial response to the Southwestern desert, when O\u2019Keeffe first visited New Mexico in 1929. She quickly became entranced with the landscape. In 1921, writing from New Mexico to the New York critic Henry McBride, O\u2019Keeffe explained that she had been collecting little and big bones \u2013 shank bones and skulls of rams, cows, and horses \u2013 that she found scattered in the desert. \u201cWhen I leave the landscape,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit seems I am going to work with these funny things that I now think feel so much like it.\u201d That year she began arranging the bones with artificial flowers and painting them as \u201ca new way of trying to define [her] feeling about that country.\u201d The works received much critical acclaim when they were first exhibited in January 1932. Horse\u2019s Skull with Pink Rose is a transitional painting linking O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s earlier flower paintings, created in New York City, and her later desert paintings. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s earlier paintings, the flower paintings of the 1920s, were richly hued and erotic and created quite a stir among the critics. By 1931, however, O\u2019Keeffe began to create softer desert flower-and-bone images that were completely different in spirit. Intending to convey the mood of the desert, O\u2019Keeffe restricted her palette to whites, blacks, and beiges that suggested the aridness and stark drama of desert life. While the use of intense hues is still evident in Horse\u2019s Skull with Pink Rose, O\u2019Keeffe simplified the palette into a contrast of a few dark/light colors. The skull and flower are arranged on an abstract field of light color, thus suggesting rather than representing the desert. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s fascination with bones continued throughout the decade, but later images of the skulls are juxtaposed against desert landscapes. In both early and late bone paintings the wind-bleached skulls act as modern icons of the Southwest. This painting marks the first work by O\u2019Keeffe in the museum\u2019s American and modern art collection and is a fine example of her Southwestern period.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997O\u2019Keeffe was one of America\u2019s most important early modernists. When she first visited New Mexico in the summer of 1929, the landscape of the Southwest so overwhelmed her that she felt she had found her true home. During her many solitary wanderings she collected bones \u2013 shanks and skulls of rams, cows, and horses \u2013 that she found scattered on the desert ground. Her most iconic desert paintings place a single skull against the panorama of a mountain range. In this earlier work she had not yet developed the idea of including the landscape: instead she tried to suggest the desert spareness through the use of a simple pale backdrop. In the large flower paintings that dominated her output during the 1920s O\u2019Keeffe employed brilliant hues: intense oranges, reds, and yellows. Her use of strong blue and pink in this work allies it with the flower images. However, the striking contrast of dark and light shows that O\u2019Keeffe was already exploring a simplified palette inspired by the elemental quality of the desert. By the mid-1930s her vision of the world was expressed in a few basic hues \u2013 whites, blacks, and beiges, colors that convey the aridness of her chosen environment. She often included a single flower with the bones, a reminder that life continues to thrive despite so much evidence of death. O\u2019Keeffe rejected elaborate wood frames, preferring simple metal strip molding, left untouched or, as here, painted.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "At the beginning of his career, early in the 1930s, Millard Sheets created several urban views of Los Angeles like Angel\u2019s Flight and Tenement Flats (1928, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.). While Sheets may have been encouraged to create such cityscapes by his early teacher, Theodore Modra (1873-1930), a disciple of Robert Henri, he was probably inspired just as much by the American Scene painting popular during the Great Depression.In Tenement Flats and Spring Street, Los Angeles, (1930, estate of the artist), Sheets presented the traditional view of city structures from ground level, possibly prompted by the example of the well-known Cliff Dwellers by George Bellows, (1913, LACMA; q.v.), which had been on view in the Los Angeles Museum since 1916. As noted by contemporary critics, however, Sheets proved more inventive with Angel\u2019s Flight: he viewed a poor section of Los Angeles from high on a hill. This unusual vantage point must have seemed logical though, given the unusually steep terrain of the area depicted, which is now known as Bunker Hill. A friend of Sheets\u2019s who also painted the Los Angeles scene, Paul Sample (born 1896), was fascinated with unusual viewpoints.The title of the painting, Angel\u2019s Flight (with the variants Angels Flight and Angels\u2019 Flight), refers to the now dismantled electric cable railway that was built in 1901 to carry pedestrians on Third Street up the steep hill from Hill Street to Olive, on the top of Bunker Hill. The funicular was built south of a road tunnel. At the same time a pedestrian stairway of 123 steps and ten ramps was constructed on the north side to give those who could not afford the railway free access to the top of Bunker Hill. On the crest of the hill a tall observation tower, known as Angel\u2019s View, was constructed. The young women in the painting -- the model for both of whom was the artist\u2019s wife, Mary -- may be standing on either the observation tower or a railway platform on the hilltop. Sheets omitted the famous cable railway and chose to view the scene looking north toward the stairway. He did not depict the stairs as straight, as they actually were, but showed them as meandering up the hill, thereby exaggerating the sense of height. Each of the buildings has a slightly different perspective vanishing point. Furthermore, the two women placed in the foreground shadow serve as repoussoir elements, introducing the viewer to the scene below, and as a contrast to the brilliantly sunlit hill below, which further exaggerates the perspective. The prominence of the figures in the foreground and the effect of the unusual viewpoint are quite baroque, a quality seen in the paintings of Thomas Hart Benson and other regionalist artists.Sheets\u2019s palette is bright and varied, with the apartment buildings and boarding houses painted in vivid orange, red, yellow, and green. The color, combined with the perspective and contrasting light and dark areas, gives the painting a distinctively dynamic quality. Despite its Social Realist subject, Angel\u2019s Flight was a precursor to Sheets\u2019s brighter, more decorative postwar compositions.Sheets painted Angel\u2019s Flight expressly for the 1931 Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh, the first major international show in which he was invited to participate. In 1932, the painting won a prize for the \"most representative work\" at the annual exhibition held at the Los Angeles Museum and was subsequently purchased for the museum. Angel\u2019s Flight is generally considered to be Sheets\u2019s masterpiece.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "The falls of the Genesee River at Rochester, New York, possess an immense power and grandeur that attracted manufacturers and artists alike to the area throughout the nineteenth century. Flowing rapidly north to Lake Ontario, the Genesee thunders down three major waterfalls in a deep gorge at Rochester: the ninety-six-foot High Falls downtown; the twenty-five-foot Middle Falls little more than a mile downriver; and, one-third of a mile further, the eighty-four-foot Lower Falls. Removed from the greatest concentration of the one hundred mills and factories that lined the river during Frederic Church\u2019s 1848 visit, the Lower Falls presented the most impressive site to draw and paint that the young artist had yet encountered. American landscape painters customarily spent summer and fall traveling to find and sketch scenes for paintings that would be completed in the studio during the winter, usually for exhibition the following spring. Church was, and remained, especially interested in waterfalls and sought them out over the course of his 1848 travels, which took him to Connecticut and southern Vermont in July and August, then on to Rochester during September and October, where he worked out his ideas for a painting of the Lower Falls. He executed seven highly detailed and annotated drawings representing every feasible vantage point of the site, the most studies of any scene he had completed up to this point in his career. While Church was drawn to the Genesee River region by the legendary falls themselves, it is quite likely that the scenery around Rochester had been recommended by Church\u2019s teacher and mentor, Thomas Cole (1801\u20131848). In 1844, Church had become the first pupil of Cole, whose reputation as the leading American landscape painter was firmly established. From 1844 until Cole\u2019s death in 1848, Church maintained a close professional relationship with Cole and was influenced by his master\u2019s ideas about landscape painting. That Cole had worked in the area in 1847, and produced the dramatic painting Genesee Scenery (Rochester Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, New York) for the American Art-Union exhibition and distribution of 1848, would have been important to Church. Cole\u2019s rendering of the powerful cascade, which dominates the center of his painting, and of the lush surrounding landscape resonates with Church\u2019s composition for Lower Falls, Rochester but also reveals how Church\u2019s approach departed from Cole\u2019s. Less allegorical and spectacular than Cole\u2019s landscapes, Church\u2019s early paintings were generally thoughtfully ordered, panoramic views of rural landscapes. Lower Falls, Rochester is an exception, and a careful study of this pivotal early work reveals how the ambitious Church developed views of landscapes that would suit not only his own aesthetics and interests but also those of his prospective patrons. The view of the Lower Falls is methodically composed with precise rendering and detail, but it is also unusually contained and focused. The eye is immediately drawn to the center of the canvas by the flash of white-painted water rushing out of the gorge and over the falls to the basin below, where the frothy rapids quickly dissolve into the serene surface of the Genesee River. This focal point\u2014coinciding with the identified subject of the painting\u2014forms part of the strong vertical axis that divides the picture into nearly symmetrical halves. This axis is completed by the mill nestled above the falls and the reflection of the white water in the river below. The rocky bluff bathed in rosy late-afternoon sun on the left counterbalances the cool, shadowy glade atop the cliff at right. The landscape opens up gently, as a book along its spine, enveloping the small boy in a white shirt fishing in the sun-splashed foreground, and the viewer as well. The first owner of Lower Falls, Rochester was Cyrus West Field (1819\u20131892), Church\u2019s good friend and emerging patron, who purchased the painting in 1849 upon its completion. Field, whose fame rests now with his successful promotion of the first transatlantic telegraph cable, made his fortune in New York City as a dealer of fine papers and specialized in tinted papers manufactured by the best mills in western Massachusetts. One of these was owned by Church\u2019s father and uncle in Lee, Mass., very close to Field\u2019s summer home in nearby Stockbridge, Mass. Field traveled to the Berkshires frequently for business and pleasure, and he and Church likely became friends around 1844, when Church was a student of Cole\u2019s. As Field\u2019s fortune grew, so did his interest in the arts, and the two visited with each other during the art student\u2019s sketching trips to Connecticut and Massachusetts. The interconnectedness of Field\u2019s and Church\u2019s professional and personal interests during the artist\u2019s formative years played a significant role in the art that Church produced (and Field collected), including influencing Church\u2019s interpretation of the Lower Falls at Rochester. Church\u2019s topographically and geologically accurate rendering of the Lower Falls site corresponded not only to his artistic interests in impressive natural phenomena but also to the mid-nineteenth century\u2019s general enthusiasm for nature and geology, an enthusiasm shared by Field. During this period, sentiments of national pride and progress were integrally tied to perceptions about the inherent marvels of the American wilderness and the wonder of its taming. Church turned his powers of observation to the flow and patterns of the water and the layering of the gray-green shale and red sandstone in the walls of the gorge, whose corresponding colors and locations he noted on his drawings of the site. A comparison of Lower Falls, Rochester with stratigraphic maps and photographs of the falls reveals the precision of Church\u2019s geological observations. Church\u2019s other major painting of 1849, West Rock, New Haven (New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Conn.) also depicts a geologically significant site\u2014and it too was bought that year by Field. Clearly, Church was astutely aware of the types of paintings that would appeal to his new patron. For both Church and Field, waterfalls symbolized the perfect balance between untouched natural splendor and a growing industrial civilization, which harnessed their power for mills. Yet Church\u2019s decision to stress the physical reality of the impressive Lower Falls required him to take liberties with man-made elements, primarily the numerous mills and other structures which existed around the falls, and which appear in several of Church\u2019s drawings. In both the final preparatory drawing and the finished oil painting at least four buildings that should appear directly to the right of the mill have been omitted. Additionally, the vantage point selected for the painting of the gorge fully obscures any view of the Middle Falls with its cluster of buildings, enabling Church\u2019s ideal composition. The result, however, is that the central mill portrayed in Lower Falls, Rochester is embraced by the surrounding landscape, nestled into the woods yet prominent. Though not identified definitively, this mill is believed to be a paper factory, of significance to both Church and Field. By removing the other structures, Church prevents the landscape from being overwhelmed by industrial architecture and instead naturalizes the presence of the mill. In keeping with an important aim of nineteenth-century landscape painting, Church\u2019s painting encouraged the (male) viewer in particular to be transported, especially through the inclusion of the boy fishing, from the busy existence of an urban and professional world to a harmonious environment, one seemingly more rural, carefree, even idyllic and timeless. Field purchased this painting from Church at the most profitable and busiest moment to date of his career. By the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, Field and Co. had accumulated a tremendous fortune and Field\u2019s business activities had reached an intensity level soon considered dangerous by his doctor. Rest and recuperation were ordered, and Field and his wife prepared for a five month vacation to Europe beginning in April 1849, exactly when the picture\u2014a marriage of the restful and the industrial that perhaps expressed Field\u2019s hopes for his own future\u2014would have gone on display in the Twenty-Fourth Annual Exhibition at the National Academy of Design, which Church had joined the preceding year. Yet Lower Falls, Rochester was not exhibited there, or elsewhere. Instead Church, the youngest Academician in the organization\u2019s history, submitted three different landscapes: A Mountain Tempest (no. 38), based on a poem by Childe Harrold and The Plague of Darkness (no. 82) representing Exodus 10:21, the texts of which were excerpted in the exhibition catalogue, and Field\u2019s West Rock, New Haven (no. 131). West Rock, New Haven was a larger, more complex American landscape than Lower Falls, Rochester, and depicted a geological site more familiar and historically significant to the National Academy\u2019s traditional New York City/New England audience. There is also evidence that another aspiring landscape painter, David Johnson, was with Church in Rochester in 1848 and painted the Lower Falls as well. It is Johnson\u2019s painting, View at the Lower Falls, Genesee River (present location unknown), that was exhibited and for sale in the 1849 exhibition (no. 216). Perhaps wanting neither to compete with his colleague nor follow too closely in the steps of Cole, whose Genesee Scenery was exhibited only the previous year, Church must have decided that the sale of this particular picture to Field was personal and professional satisfaction enough. Church\u2019s intellectual and artistic approaches to the Lower Falls site represent his earliest attempts both to interpret the splendor of a major waterfall within its surroundings, natural and man-made, and to create landscapes of particular meaning and significance. The enclosed, almost private view of the Lower Falls and the painting\u2019s relatively small size and intimate feel differ markedly from the highly public, large-scale paintings he soon began to create. Once Church traveled to South America in 1853, with Field, his expression of the landscape changed. The balance between man and nature shifted, as wondrous natural phenomena came to fully dwarf any human presence. Immense paintings of such sublime marvels as Niagara Falls and the exotic mountainous landscapes of the South American Andes resonated not with one specific patron but with thousands who paid to be astounded by the professed \"amazing\" naturalistic details of these works. Lower Falls, Rochester was a crucial essay for the young Church, from the record number of preparatory drawings, to the subject matter, to the careful choices he made concerning the painting and its effects on his artistic and professional development and patronage. It was not exhibited publicly until 1966, when it hung in the first major retrospective of Church\u2019s paintings held since the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s memorial exhibition of 1900. It remained in the Field family until the mid-1970s, a testimony to its appeal to Field and his descendants. Lower Falls, Rochester was one of seven paintings in the landmark 1994 Charles C. and Elma Ralphs Shoemaker bequest of nineteenth-century American paintings to the museum. It fills a major gap in the museum\u2019s representation of Hudson River School paintings, being the first, and only, work by Church to enter the American art collection.

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Martin Johnson Heade (1819-1904) was one of the central figures in the American luminist movement, a late manifestation of the Hudson River school of landscape painting. During the third quarter of the 19th century, landscape artists such as Heade combined accurate, naturalistic detail with brilliant illumination and a sense of order and harmony to create timeless, silent images that seemingly defy their specificity. Among Heade\u2019s most prized works are his views of the salt marshes around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, along the New Jersey coast, and in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Rhode Island Shore dates from the artist\u2019s first stay in Providence, in 1858, when he initially turned to the theme. The site \u2013 Church Cove in Mount Hope Bay looking toward Mount Hope \u2013 was rich in historical associations. This was the place where King Philip, the chief of the Wampanoag Indians, died in 1676. Although his death marked a critical point in the subjugation of the Indians of southern New England by the European settlers, the landscape as it appeared in the mid-19th century offered no hint of this past conflict. Yet the 19th-century public would have been well aware of the site\u2019s significance. The serenity of the scene also belied the actual turbulence of Heade\u2019s own era. Through such hushed images as Rhode Island Shore as well as other placid harbor views and picturesque scenes of the Eastern coast, luminists offered the American viewing public a sense of order and clam at a time when heightening political, social, and economic tensions were erupting into a bloody civil war. Heade\u2019s marsh scenes, of which Rhode Island Shore is the earliest known example, are panoramas of flat terrains punctuated by small mounds of hay. Most of the marsh scenes are small in scale, presented in a narrow, open-ended horizontal format. The sky, often in dramatic sunset hues, usually dominates at least half of the composition. All is meticulously painted, the brushstrokes barely discernible. Nothing is allowed to distract the observer from the simplicity and order of the tautly composed landscapes. Even humans are absent, although the haystacks signify the presence of an important industry derived from the marshy swamp area. The scenes gain their quiet power from the abstract relationships of horizontals and verticals, a limited vocabulary of harmonious contrasts. Although the views often appear airless, they are about light and atmosphere. Because Rhode Island Shore was the first of Heade\u2019s marsh paintings, it does not strictly conform to his later, more characteristic haystack scenes but instead suggests affinities to the earlier Hudson River School aesthetic from which it emerged. Larger and squarer in format, the scene is also livelier and more atmospheric, with the view framed by a large dark tree on the right. Yet the elements that are the hallmark of Heade\u2019s mature art and the quintessential luminist approach are already present. Through the generosity of the late Charles and Elma Shoemaker, the Los Angeles public can now enjoy Rhode Island Shore in all its delicate splendor, a gentle reminder of our nation\u2019s nostalgic desire for tranquility.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Although he achieved success with his ship portraits, Birch\u2019s distinctive contribution to American art was his more romantic renderings of ships in storms, such as Loss of the Schooner \"John S. Spence\" . . . . In his cool palette, evocative sky, and turbulent sea Birch reveals the influence of Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), a French marine painter whose imaginative works were available to the artist in Philadelphia. Although Birch was actually depicting the aftermath of the storm, he still conveyed its power through the vigorous waves, overcast sky, brisk wind, and the narrative element of the destroyed ship.Although some of Birch\u2019s stormy marines were fictional, at least two, the museum\u2019s painting and The Loss of the New York Packet Ship \"Albion,\" exhibited 1824 (unlocated), were based on actual events. The schooner \"John S. Spence\" was lost at sea not long after it had left the port of Norfolk, Virginia, bound for Havana, Cuba. The museum\u2019s painting was commissioned by Alexander M. Peltz, one of the passengers on the schooner during its last voyage. At the age of nineteen Peltz, desirous adventure, left his home in Washington, D.C., and on August 19, 1827, set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, on the \"Spence\" in the company of a childhood friend, intending to travel to Mexico to join the company of the former US commodore David Porter. Six days later the schooner was wrecked in a storm on the open sea, its bowsprit and taffrail broken, and its masts transformed into a confusion of ropes and broken wood. Five survivors, including Pelz-but not his friend-were rescued a week after the wreck by a New England captain, Isaac Staples of the brig \"Cobosse Contee,\" but only three lived to reach New York. Peltz originally intended to give the painting to Captain Staples, his rescuer. Staples was lost at sea before the painting was completed, however, so it remained in Peltz\u2019s family until 1982. Shortly before his death Peltz wrote an account of the voyage, disaster, and struggle to survive without food and water. Birch no doubt based much of his rendering on Peltz\u2019s oral account, for the written account demonstrates that he vividly recalled the details of the disaster. When the painting was exhibited in 1834 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts it was listed as a \"second view.\" Birch used the incident as the basis for an engraving that appeared in the 1836 volume of The Token; however, this drawn The Wreck at Sea is a close-up view from on board the \"Spence\" rather than from the distant perspective, and it depicts only four men being rescued.",

As a young artists she went to Paris to study and there became the French master\u2019s student and studio assistant. Column of Life was modeled in Rodin\u2019s studio. When he discovered Hoffman playing with a small lump of clay, Rodin saw that she had delicately manipulated the material to suggest two lovers. He told her, \u201cThere is more here than you understand at present,\u201d and suggested that she not attempt to enlarge the piece until she was a more accomplished artist. Years later Hoffman transformed the tiny sculpture into a larger work, creating both marble and bronze versions. It is only in the bronze, with its warm, golden-brown patina, that Hoffman fully expressed the sensuality of the theme. As a man and woman embrace, their two bodies merge into one flowing form. Such evocative symbolism was new to American sculpture, and Rodin was largely responsible for American artists abandoning the literalism of earlier figurative sculpture. In Column of Life Hoffman focused on the grand emotion of erotic love, suggesting its transformative power through subtly evocative forms.",

Trained as a lithographer in his home state of Pennsylvania, Brown moved to northern California in 1860, where he worked for the renowned printmaking studio, Kuchel and Dresel. Brown eventually began his own highly successful lithography company in San Francisco, where he designed and printed commercial advertisements, maps, and city views for local businesses such a Levi Strauss and Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. In 1879, Brown sold the business to concentrate on his passion for exploring and painting the landscapes of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. Brown\u2019s View of Mount Rainier comes from this particular time in the artist\u2019s career. Like his French contemporaries, the Impressionists, Brown was fascinated by the effect of light and atmospheric changes on a single, outdoor subject. He repeatedly returned to the same natural settings to capture them at different angles, and in different weather and seasons. LACMA\u2019s painting is one of several documenting the artist\u2019s studies of Washington\u2019s MountTacoma (now Mount Rainier). However, unlike the loose, gestural style of the Impressionists, Brown\u2019s paintings maintain the meticulous realist perspective and line of his lithographs.",

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings.

      "curator notes" : "The location of this landscape has been identified as Newport, Rhode Island. Whittredge may have first visited the area as early as 1859, immediately following his return to America. He visited it often and even built a summer house there. He became fascinated with the colonial architecture of the area, drawing and painting Bishop George Berkeley\u2019s house, Whitehall. Whittredge\u2019s first Newport painting dates from 1865, and in the early 1870s he began a series of Newport landscapes in which the focus was a shingled, gambrel-roofed farmhouse near the sea. In most of these landscapes, such as Home by the Sea, c. 1872 (Westmoreland County Museum of Art, Greensburg, Pennsylvania), and Old Homestead by the Sea, 1883 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), the artist assumed an elevated position away from the house to obtain an expansive view of the surrounding countryside and distant ocean.A Home by the Seaside is the only painting in this series in which Whittredge moved closer to the house, which serves as a framing device leading the viewer into the scene and down the hill to the field below where men are working. The image of hayers was a popular motif, frequently used by Whittredge and other artists of the period to convey the nationalistic pride of a country rich in natural resources and human energy. Although Whittredge explained his attraction to Newport as returning to the land of his forefathers, a land made familiar to him through tales heard as a child, his fascination was also part of a general cultural trend during the late nineteenth century called the colonial revival. The farmhouse in A Home by the Seaside has not been specifically identified, but its type and age added a note of native picturesqueness to the scene. Whittredge did not depict Newport as the fashionable summer resort of the elite but as the land he had heard about as a child. The soft autumnal haze contributes to the general sentiment of nostalgia.By the 1870s Whittredge had become known for his serene, sun-filled, open landscapes. When this painting was exhibited, such critics as George Sheldon praised its diffused light and quiet mood.",

Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "William R. Hamilton\u2019s Alexander Masterton and His Wife and Children is a charming and rare example of the conversation piece in early American art. Most fully developed in 18th-century Britain, the conversation piece was a specific type of group portrait that usually depicted a family involved in some everyday activity. The Museum\u2019s conversation piece is unusual for its large scale and the incorporation of landscape and genre painting into portraiture. Its presence in the 19 th-century American art gallery adds a new dimension to the Museum\u2019s collection. When the Scottish-born William Hamilton arrived in this country in the early 1830s, he brought with him this tradition and used it to demonstrate his talent at the annual exhibitions of the National Academy of Design. His 1833 exhibits included an elaborate group portrait of the James Wotherspoon family; so impressive was the painting that Hamilton was elected an Associate member of the esteemed institution \u2013 a great honor for someone new to the New York art scene. The dearth of conversation pieces in American art is surprising since such family portraits reflected the mores of the rising middle class. The majority of the country\u2019s artists until Hamilton \u2019s era created modest bus-and half-length depictions of single figures. Due to the expense full-length portraits were primarily the domain of public, commemorative commissions, while group portraits often appealed to private patrons, who were usually wealthy and prominent men. Alexander Masterton accumulated a fortune as one of the country\u2019s major architect-builders, responsible for the construction of the Bank of the United States , the New York Customs House, and many other important public and private buildings in the Greek Revival style. His marble-quarrying firm was so successful that he could afford to buy a country home in Bronxville and to commission this elaborate portrait, two major status symbols of the period. Masterton may have actually brought Hamilton to this country, for he, like the artist and most of Hamilton \u2019s other sitters, was Scottish-born. Hamilton \u2019s group portraits were known for their outdoor locales and inclusion of picturesque detail. Prior to Hamilton \u2019s arrival, only Ralph Earl, working in late 18th-century Connecticut, repeatedly incorporated landscapes into his portraits. The setting of the Museum\u2019s painting may have been Masterton\u2019s Bronxville estate, for the portrait remained there with the family until the mid-1980s. Hamilton presented the Masterton family dressed in their Sunday best, enjoying simple country pleasures: the two youngest children remain under the protection of their parents, while the older sons fish, and the family dog takes a nap. The verdant green foliage, garland of flowers, and spacious forest glade all suggest a comfortable life of prosperity and leisure.Ilene Susan Fort. \u201cRecent Acquisition.\u201d At The Museum 31 (March 1993): 12.",

      "label" : "Finding his position as portrait painter to a duke in Scotland limiting, William Hamilton moved to New York City in 1832. There he immediately impressed the art community and potential patrons with his skill in creating elaborate, multi-figured portrait compositions such as this one. Trained in London and Paris in the tradition of \u201cgrand manner\u201d portraiture, Hamilton here created a tour de force, combining lifelike portraits with amusing anecdotal details, such as the dog sniffing the fish on the grass. The lush natural setting hints at the American enthusiasm for wilderness and also demonstrates Hamilton\u2019s love of landscape painting. This \u201cconversations piece,\u201d as such group portraits in informal settings are called, depicts the entire Masterton family enjoying their Sunday leisure. Although the wealthy sitter had a country home in Bronxville, near New York City, the house in the background and the river setting are imaginary. Plain, Federal-style frames such as this one, with its decoration limited to a single large acanthus leaf in each corner, became popular early in the nineteenth century and continued to embody the common virtues promoted during the Jacksonian era. This frame, the original, also suited the Greek Revival-style buildings constructed in New York City by the sitter.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "Among the first paintings acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Cliff Dwellers is still its best known and most often reproduced American painting. A large part of the work\u2019s attraction to students of American history has been the fact that it appears to stand out among Ash Can school paintings as a statement of strong social criticism. This interpretation has been derived not so much from the appearance of the canvas as from the fact that it is very similar to the drawing Why Don\u2019t They Go to the Country for a Vacation? (1913, LACMA), executed by Bellows for the socialist journal The Masses and published as the frontispiece of its issue of August 1913. Almost all the Ash Can school artists who contributed to The Masses stopped short of creating outright political statements. For the most part, they simply considered themselves to be realist artists, producing vignettes of urban life that fit with the journal\u2019s alert, down-to-earth editorial tone. Their consciously artistic, realist drawings of indulgent social satire are distinctly different from the bald editorial cartooning that also appeared in The Masses. Their paintings were yet further removed from the editorial tone of the magazine. John Sloan, for instance, who occasionally contributed scathing editorial cartoons to The Masses, did not express any sense of social criticism in his paintings, which portray the energy and simple pleasures of the poor. One cannot find in Cliff Dwellers any trace of a change in tone from Bellows\u2019s other urban scenes, whose subject and spirit center on the excitement and bustling activity of the city and the surging vitality of its lower classes. The spirit of the scene is established by the innocent joie de vivre of the brightly lighted foreground group of young women and children, especially the bawling, grinning, brawling boys so familiar in Bellows\u2019s works. Another prominent note is the mother ascending the stairs on the far right, so reminiscent of the hard-working homemakers of Daumier and Chardin. On the far left, the bright colors of a market cart attract the eye. Except for the large building in deep shadow, the effect is that of sunshine, with a stiff breeze lifting some of the laundry. The irregular angles of the streets and the streetcar\u2019s \"Vesey Street\" destination sign suggest that this is a location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan between the Bowery and Catherine Slip below Chatam Square. Bellows\u2019s record book indicates that the painting was completed in May 1913. He wrote the title originally as Cliff Dwellers but then crossed out the definite article. As noted in his record book during April 1913, Bellows completed three drawings for The Masses, including the museum\u2019s drawing reproduced in the August 1913 issue. Its title was recorded as Why Don\u2019t They Go to the Country for a Vacation? but is also identified, in parentheses, as \"(study for) Cliff Dwellers.\" The fact that the drawing reproduced in The Masses was completed at a time when Bellows very well may have been working on Cliff Dwellers raises the question of whether that drawing may originally have been made in preparation for the painting and then given a second life as a frontispiece in the magazine. On the other hand, the drawing is a transfer lithograph reworked with pen and ink, an uncharacteristic working method for Bellows, but one that he used for other Masses illustrations, which suggests that the drawing was done especially for the magazine. The record book reveals that Cliff Dwellers was organized according to a disciplined color scheme, primarily based on the ideas of the color theorist and paint supplier Hardesty G. Maratta (1864-1924), which were of much interest to Bellows, Robert Henri, and others in the 1910s. The painting\u2019s palette is indicated as: Three c[h]ords. Orange -- Red-purple -- Green -blue. Blue-purple -- Green -- Red-orange Yellow-green -- Red -- Blue [colors indicated by initials in original] \"Chords\" were a concept of Maratta\u2019s, triads of usually complementary colors that were chosen, like notes of the musical scale, to establish a particular harmony and mood for a painting. These chords of colors appear to work in different sections of Cliff Dwellers. In the produce wagon the first chord of orange, red-purple, and green-blue can be found, and these colors recur throughout the lower section of the painting in the crowd. Even the notes of yellow and blue there probably were created by mixing a good deal of white with the orange and the blue-green of the chord. The blue-purple of the second chord can be said to dominate the shadowed building at the left, with its green shutters and red brick wall. The wall, however, has too much blue in it to be called a red-orange. The yellow-green of the third chord is prominent in the lighted building at the right, although its patches of red and blue both tend toward purple. The chords are similar enough to blend easily into a unified painting with areas of relative emphasis on one chord or another. Bellows\u2019s remarkable skill at mixing together different colors on the canvas, as he painted wet-into-wet, also enriched Cliff Dwellers with a multitude of intermediate hues that soften the discipline of what was to have been a limited palette while at the same time contributing to the quality of unity. Along with Maratta\u2019s system of colors, Henri, Bellows, and other students of Henri\u2019s spent long hours studying and elaborating Maratta\u2019s approach to composition, which sought a similar harmony and balance, using a structure of simple geometrical forms. Bellows\u2019s fascination with geometrical compositions after about 1917 is well known, but technical aspects of Cliff Dwellers suggest that his efforts in that direction had begun by at least 1913. Bellows appears to have inserted at least ninety pins into the canvas at regular intervals, making horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows. He apparently painted around them and then pulled them out while the paint was still soft, leaving very small craters, some of which he painted over. In a few areas, where the paint is thinner, portions of diagonal lines in red paint can be seen. These coincide with diagonal rows of pinholes and may have been used either at an earlier stage of the painting or to establish the rows. The intervals between the rows were established so that the pinholes form equilateral triangles, the key concept of the Maratta system. Some of these relate closely to elements of the composition. For instance, the figure of a woman with a fan in the lower right corner has a pinhole at the top of her head and at the point of each elbow. Other features, such as the strong edge of the silhouetted building to the right of center, are aligned with rows of pinholes. Of course, numerous geometrical forms can be constructed from a web of pinholes like this one. Further study of geometry in Bellows\u2019s earlier paintings will be necessary to establish which regular forms he used and how they contributed to his compositional objectives. Another question is posed by the numerous, apparently random pinholes in the museum\u2019s related drawing. Were they somehow used to transfer elements of the design, while aligning them with the structure of the painting? The painting was well received, winning five hundred dollars and the third-prize medal in the annual exhibition of 1914 at the Carnegie Institute of Art, Pittsburgh. It toured the country and was shown in Los Angeles several times, in group and solo Bellows exhibitions, before its purchase by the museum on September 16, 1916. Although it was not included in the catalogue of the museum\u2019s exhibition of contemporary American paintings in the summer of 1916, the American Art News states that it was bought out of that exhibition.",

      "label" : "Cliff Dwellers was the first painting purchased by the county of Los Angeles for its fledgling museum, in 1916. Although Bellows was a relatively young artist at the time, the painting was destined to become one of the most celebrated in American art. This depiction of the Lower East Side of Manhattan conveys the lifestyle of the many immigrants that flooded American cities in the early twentieth century. The people are poor, living in cramped apartments, with too many children to feed; the children have the character of untrustworthy street urchins. Yet scenes such as this were not intended to be critical of foreigners of their living conditions; indeed, the activity has a lighthearted, almost circuslike quality. Although not meant as a call to alleviate poverty of overcrowded slums, this painting did reflect the topical issue of urban reform, for the plight of the urban poor was often discussed in the newspapers of the day.Cliff Dwellers summarizes the aesthetics of the ashcan school, promoted by Robert Henri, Bellows\u2019 teacher at the New York School of Art. Already in 1906 a newspaper critic realized that Henri\u2019s students were painting \u201cManhattan everyday life\u2026not idealized and worked up into unnatural \u2018effect\u2019 but truthfully and powerfully and without flattery.\u201d Bellows chose a rough edged brush and a gritty palette to render the harsh actualities of people\u2019s lives.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school.

As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Sully considered the high point of his life to be the trip he made to London in 1837 to paint a full-length portrait of the young Queen Victoria. The artist\u2019s journal entry of September 18, 1837, records that Edward Carey, a publisher and art collector, suggested that Sully make the trip to England and offered him one hundred dollars in advance for pictures to be painted either in England or on the artist\u2019s return to Philadelphia. Sully\u2019s \"Register of Pictures\" indicates that he painted The Gypsy Girl for Carey for a price of three hundred dollars, designing it in England before beginning it in Philadelphia on February 24, 1839, and finishing it there on September 9, 1839. In an apparent contradiction Sully\u2019s journal entry for January 25, 1839, indicates that he \"began ... England.\"Sully is best known as a portraitist, but of the more than twenty-six hundred paintings he made, nearly six hundred were genre and thematic paintings, what he called \"fancy pictures.\" Of these, more than two dozen were of peasant children like this gypsy girl, a subject that appealed very much to early Victorian taste and the purchasers of the period\u2019s elaborately illustrated gift books. The Gypsy Girl appeared in the 1842 volume of The Gift: A Christmas and New Year\u2019s Present as an engraved illustration for Charles West Thomson\u2019s poem \"The Gipsy\u2019s Chaunt.\"Sully\u2019s register records other paintings of gypsy Children, some made as early as 1828, and drawings survive. However, the specific inspiration for Sully\u2019s The Gypsy Girl, the \"Hints obtained in England,\" may have been A Gipsy Girl, 1794 (Royal Academy of Arts, London), the diploma picture of Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), which Sully would have had a chance to see in London at the Royal Academy of Arts. Known to his admirers as \"the American Lawrence,\" Sully was a great admirer of the English artists as the dramatic style of his own The Gypsy Girl attests, in its dramatic contrasts, flowing lines and rich, warm color.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "In Paris Eakins had been thoroughly trained in the academic system of preparing extensive studies before beginning a major painting. He practiced this approach all his life and taught it to his pupils. Before undertaking his paintings of the boxers and other athletes that he painted at the end of the 1890s, Eakins spent hours watching the men, studying their movements in light of his knowledge of anatomy. He posed two wrestlers in the Quaker City Athletic Club and in his studio, where in May 1899 several photographs were taken. The man on top is Joseph McCann, a wrestler and champion boxer. He is posed holding his opponent in a half nelson and crotch hold, potentially close to winning. Eakins copied the photograph of this pose almost directly onto a canvas, 1899 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), the purpose of which would have been to clarify the details of musculature that were unclear in the photograph.The next step in the preparatory process was the museum's small oil painting, which served as a compositional sketch. In it the artist worked out the placement of the figures in the composition of the finished canvas Wrestlers, 1899, also owned by the LACMA. Eakins made some slight changes in the positions of the wrestlers, especially in the right leg of the lower man and in the head and shoulders of the upper man. Eakins's main interest was in placing them in relation to the figures he was now introducing, the lower body of an observer or referee on the right and a man at a rowing machine in the upper left. The short white line at the referee's foot represents the rope that marked off the boundaries of the wrestling arena. The men were nude in the photograph and initial figure study but wear trunks in the large finished version. The black area in the museum's sketch that looks as though it might represent trunks probably is only an indication of an area of shadow. Athletes in the period wore light-colored trunks that were cut very high over the hips as seen in the finished painting. Achieving the proper balance within the composition was especially important to Eakins at this point in his career, because of his increased awareness of surface design and internal structure. Like most artists at the turn of the century Eakins introduced into his paintings devices that had the effect of compromising the illusion of depth while creating a more even, overall, decorative pattern; in this example he did so by the placement of the rower in the extreme upper left corner and by cropping the standing man with the top edge of the painting, which pulls what is normally the part farthest away into the same plane as that of the foreground figures of the wrestlers. William Preston Harrison bought the oil sketch upon the advice of CHILDE HASSAM, when it was exhibited in Los Angeles.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions.

      "curator notes" : "Soon after developing his more brightly colored impressionist style during the early 1910s, Redmond became identified with his paintings of poppy fields, meeting a steady demand with not a few potboilers. It is easy to imagine why this subject should have become so popular, since the dry, nearly colorless native Southern California landscape offers nothing to compare with the broad expanses of poppies, lupine, and other wildflowers that transform the landscape with their brief springtime blossoming during several weeks in February and March. The carpet of bright flowers is seen against the more delicate colors of the brush and foliage that have been freshened by the winter rains. Like many others of his mature works, the museum\u2019s exceptionally large and impressive example was painted on an especially rough fabric that adds to the strong sense of overall texture. Redmond\u2019s brushstrokes, distinct, short dashes of color strongly suggesting intervening atmosphere, contribute to this sense of texture. Except for accents, such as the blooms in this painting, Redmond\u2019s palette is usually deeper than that of many of the American impressionists. Its ownership by Raymond Griffith suggests a date for the museum\u2019s painting of around the time of his association with the artist in 1926.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "The Preparedness Parade down Fifth Avenue in New York on May 13, 1916, demonstrated America\u2019s readiness to fight in World War I and kindled Hassam\u2019s patriotic fervor, prompting him to begin his famous series of flag paintings. By the end of the war he would create approximately thirty oil paintings of New York bedecked with displays of banners and flags as part of the home-front effort to inspire patriotism and help raise funds for war relief efforts. Fifth Avenue was often decorated, and for the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive in the autumn of 1918 it became known as the Avenue of the Allies, each block from Twenty-fourth to Fifty-eighth streets being devoted to the flags of a particular Allied country. Hassam painted five pictures of Fifth Avenue during this celebration. In the museum\u2019s version the artist depicted the block between Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth streets, on which Brazil was represented. The flag of that country, a yellow diamond on a ground of bright green with a blue orb in the center, appears not only as the large flag waving in the center of the composition but also directly to the right and in a large grouping of flags to the left. The block south of Brazil was devoted to the British Empire and the one north to Belgium, so Hassam shows the New Zealand flag flying in the foreground and the flag of Belgium, a threebanded design with black on the top (Hassam always used dark blue), yellow in the center, and red on the bottom, flying behind the flag of Brazil. The flag of the United States also appears several times, hanging from buildings and in the distance across the thoroughfare. The painting closest to this one is Avenue of the Allies, Great Britain, 1918 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), in which Hassam depicted almost the same section of Fifth Avenue looking uptown but from the west side of the street rather than the east, so that the configuration of flags appears slightly different. The two versions share Hassam\u2019s use of architectural components -- tall, sheetlike buildings -- on both sides of the picture to frame the flag scene. Street scenes were far from new in Hassam\u2019s oeuvre, for he had been fascinated with the hustle-and-bustle of the urban crowds since his early days in Boston. In the earlier images, however, figures usually assume a larger role. In the flag paintings it is the flags, not the figures, that are of primary importance. In the series Hassam experimented with the view, point, depicting the street from varying elevations-street level, slightly higher, above the flags, and even rooftop viewpoints. Hassam no doubt was inspired by the flag celebrations painted by Claude Monet (1840-1926) and other French impressionists, and his first flag paintings were watercolors done in Paris in 1889 during festivities for Bastille Day on July 14. The flags increasingly became the main source of movement and decoration as the series progressed, as they not only became larger but also were more prominently placed. In the paintings from late 1918 such as this one Hassam viewed the flags from below to emphasize their size and positioned them in or near the center of the compositions against a pale sky to form a lively, two-dimensional pattern of colors and designs above the pedestrian-filled street. While the large flags strung across the street wave in the wind, a sense of air and movement is conveyed equally well through the pale palette and exceptionally sketchy, even unfinished surface. The museum\u2019s painting was often exhibited during the years right after the war as part of Hassam\u2019s flag series. In 1919 an unsuccessful attempt was made by a committee of New Yorkers to purchase through popular subscription a group of the flag paintings as a permanent war memorial. The lithograph Avenue of the Allies, used as the frontispiece of A. E. Gallatin\u2019s Art and the Great War (1919), differs only slightly from the museum\u2019s painting in the details of a few of the foreground figures. William Preston Harrison\u2019s overwhelming enthusiasm for the art of Hassam, rather than his patriotism, may have been the crucial factor in his decision to purchase this painting.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Although Cole made his early reputation with his romantic interpretations of the American wilderness, his chief interest was in ideal landscapes rather than realistic depictions of specific locations. He painted his first pair of ideal compositions, The Garden of Eden, 1828 (unlocated), and Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, 1828 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), even before his first trip to Europe in 1829, by which time he already had compiled a long list of ideal subjects; among them the paired titles L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. Paired and serial paintings were to occupy much of his interest and best efforts over the following years. A commission from the collector Charles M. Parker permitted Cole to undertake the paintings L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. On January 8, 1844, Cole wrote to Parker: \"I intend to commence two pictures, to be called L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. In the first picture, I should represent a sunny luxuriant landscape, with figures engaged variously in gay pastimes or pleasant occupation. In the second picture, I would represent some ivy clad ruin in the solemn evening twilight, with a solitary figure musing among the decaying grandeur .... The subject ... is one upon which I can work conamore.\" The paintings are dated 1845 and were exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in the spring of 1846, but with the titles Italian Sunset and View of Lago de Nemi, near Rome. Il Penseroso is based fairly closely upon a detailed view of Lake Nemi with the town of Nemi that Cole had drawn in 1832. He drew the shrine on the notebook\u2019s facing page, as a repositioned foreground element of the landscape, and transferred its design to the painting with the same degree of fidelity, leading one to conclude that the shrine was an actual structure, possibly at that location. The trees behind the shrine and figure before it are the only major elements not present in the drawing. In contrast to Il Penseroso\u2019s specific and realistic portrayal, L\u2019Allegro seems to be a completely ideal and imaginary landscape. The conventionally picturesque composition resembles a sketch now apparently misidentified as a study for the 1838 painting A Dream of Arcadia. To this framework Cole introduced various architectural elements. The art historian Wayne Craven has pointed out the resemblance of the Doric colonnade in the left distance to the early Greek temples in Italy that Cole had traveled to see and paint in 1832 and 1842. The other ruins are more difficult to identify specifically. The right foreground arches, which resume on the other side of the river, could be the remains of a Roman bridge, but they also recall the Claudian aqueduct painted by Cole on several occasions. The brickwork, however, is unlike that in Cole\u2019s other depictions of the monument. The softness of Cole\u2019s rendering of the circular temple on the extreme right suggests that he did not intend to depict any specific ruin. The hilltop town near the center of the painting likewise has a generalized, ideal quality, unlike the detailed accuracy of Cole\u2019s rendering of the town of Nemi in Il Penseroso. Whereas Il Penseroso is an actual view, L\u2019Allegro belongs to the tradition of ideal arcadian landscapes composed by Cole and many others of his generation and earlier. The titles Il Penseroso and L\u2019Allegro refer to a pair of poems by John Milton, one characterizing a cheerful and the other a melancholy outlook. Cole\u2019s landscapes contain none of the setting and specific detail of the poems (except, in a general sense, for the dance in L\u2019Allegro), but they do present contrasting moods. Rather than illustrating the poems, the paintings translate their overall meaning into the visual language of landscape. The pair represents approximately the same time of day, late afternoon, but the degree of brightness and relative warmth of the light differ because of the terrain. The horizon of L\u2019Allegro is low, the foreground water reflecting even more of the generous expanse of sky. The distance of the one large hill contributes to the feeling of openness and light. The scene is bathed in the warm Claudian light of contentment. In a landscape filled with references to antiquity, the foreground dancer, his pose modeled after the Dancing Faun from the House of the Faun in Pompeii (Museo Nazionale, Naples), suggests the survival of a pagan strain among the peasants of the day, as had Donatello in Hawthorne\u2019s The Marble Faun. L\u2019Allegro evokes the innocent joyfulness of the arcadian ideal. In contrast, the encircling walls of Lake Nemi\u2019s crater in Il Penseroso shut out both light and sky, their shaggy slopes looming ominously. The painting is both darker and cooler than L\u2019Allegro. The rough foreground foliage and forested background seem more agitated than the broad expanse of smoothness of L\u2019Allegro. Although the foreground of Il Penseroso is near the Grove of Diana, off to the left, and the site recalls the pagan past (with some of its most somber associations), the painting is dominated by associations with Italy\u2019s Christian piety: a shrine to the Virgin built upon the medieval fortifications of Nemi. In contrast to the merry peasants of L\u2019Allegro, the foreground figure kneels with an abjectness suggesting grief. The pair of paintings expresses the sense of Milton\u2019s poems in terms of highly sophisticated concepts-in the opposition of the conventions of picturesque and sublime landscape and in terms of Italian architectural and intellectual history. As embodied in these paintings, Cole\u2019s concept of ideal landscape is so rich with intellectual and poetic content that the two form a complex unit, depending upon each other for their complete meaning.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Thomas Cole is considered the founder of the landscape tradition known as the Hudson River school. Although he was esteemed during his own time for his American wilderness scenes, he preferred composing idealized images, such as this pair, L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso. Imaginary landscapes of this type were often based on biblical or literary sources that promoted an elevated character. Cole\u2019s idealized landscapes may have been his responses to the uncertainties of his age; the artist feared that Jacksonian democracy, with its emphasis on populism, might lead to the deterioration of society. Cole created L\u2019Allegro and Il Penseroso late in life for his patron, the collector Charles M. Parker of New York City. Though inspired by poems with the same titles by Englishman John Milton, Cole did not illustrate their narratives but rather suggested their moods. Mirth and contemplation are conveyed through the use of sunlight and shadow and the activities of the figures in the two paintings. In L\u2019Allegro Italian peasants are dancing and making music at the edge of a river, in contrast to Il Penseroso, where a single peasant woman is quietly praying at a roadside shrine.The reproduction of the original frame on L\u2019Allegro (which is lost) was modeled after the frame on Il Penseroso. It was made in 1974, when the museum was able to reunite the pair.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "Ryder\u2019s work is among the most powerfully visionary and formally expressive that our country has produced. So strong are his small paintings that Ryder\u2019s life-work of only about 160 paintings has been sufficient to generate a posthumous reputation amounting at times to adulation. Although firmly based in naturalism, Ryder\u2019s style involved the extreme simplification of elements and their arrangement in terms of an overall rhythmic force and harmony. Like others of his pure landscapes, The River is closer to naturalism than to the dramatic designs characteristic of Ryder\u2019s literary subjects and nocturnal marines. The scale of the indistinct figures in the left foreground and near the center of the right edge of the painting suggests that they are staffage rather than specific literary characters. As a delicately colored daytime scene rather than his characteristically more emotional nocturnal or crepuscular views, The River also partakes more of the quality of a straightforward landscape, albeit with the visionary feeling that informs all of the artist\u2019s works. Ryder never dated his paintings, and the unequal deterioration of different works adds to the difficulty of establishing dates. Ryder\u2019s friend, the artist Charles Melville Dewey (1849-1937), suggested that The River could be dated between 1884 and 1894. He also indicated that the painting stood on an easel at Ryder\u2019s bedside during his last illness. Because Ryder is known to have reworked his paintings again and again, it is difficult to determine how much of the final design dates from the period specified by Dewey. As is characteristic of Ryder\u2019s work, scientific examination of The River reveals a substantially different earlier design. Infrared photography, which can show changes just below the surface layer, reveals changes near the center of the right-hand edge of the painting: there is a second ghostly figure, and the distinctly rounded, archlike shape of the dark area behind the figures suggests that it is the entrance to a cave or building (see illustration). These two figures probably represent an earlier placement of the two figures in the left foreground rather than additional figures relating to them in a narrative sense. The fact that the painting came into the possession of Ryder\u2019s executor, Charles Melville Dewey, raises the question of whether The River may have been completed by Dewey, who had restored certain deteriorated paintings with Ryder\u2019s approval and presumably with his advice. Perhaps he was the one who filled and inpainted the large cracks, work that appears to have been done before the painting was acquired by Paul Rodman Mabury in 1920. It was Lloyd Goodrich\u2019s opinion that Dewey did not repaint the picture; he wrote to the museum in 1962, \"I hasten to add that your painting seems to me entirely characteristic of Ryder in style and technique, and that it shows no evidence of having been tampered with.\"",

      "label" : "Albert Pinkham Ryder is the great romantic painter of American art and, according to the historian Lewis Mumford, one of the most significant painters of the Brown Decades (1865-95), along with Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer. Ryder, an eccentric and increasingly a recluse, created a shadowy world of dreams. His lack of concern for proper painting techniques and his use of such unstable materials as bitumen resulted in his pigments darkening and his paint surface cracking and sliding off the canvas. By 1920, when The River was acquired by Paul R. Mabury, it had deteriorated so much that its cracks had already been restored and inpainted. The present condition of The River is typical of Ryder\u2019s art and in a way intensifies his visionary quality. Figures such as the one in the arched doorway at the right appear as phantoms, barely discernible at first glance. Though Ryder derived some of his themes from literature, music, and opera, most of his landscapes and marines were from his own imagination. His paintings were greatly admired by the first generation of modernists, who realized how much he had liberated American art from the materialism of the Victorian age. The softly modulated art nouveau pattern of swirling forms on the frame accords well with the insubstantial quality of the painted scene. The frame dates from the late 1910s. It was probably added to the canvas after the artist\u2019s death, when the painting was for sale at the Chicago firm of Carson, Pirie, Scott and Co.; a label from this dealer remains on the frame\u2019s back.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Sargent executed several studies of male nudes, which were probably painted during or soon after his student years at the private atelier of Carolus-Duran. While Man Wearing Laurels is a bust-length study, a more elaborate painting of perhaps the same man wearing laurels, A Male Model Standing before a Stove, late 1870s (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), indicates that the figure is a professional model posing in a studio. French academic training extolled the human form as the major vehicle of expression. Usually the student was forced to develop his draftsmanship through meticulous drawings. Only after gaining a command of the human figure was the student permitted to use paint. Carolus-Duran was considered a radical in his methods because he encouraged his students to merge drawing with painting. He emphasized tonal painting as the means to construct form and stated, \"Search for the values.... Establish the half tints (la demiteinte) as a basis, then a few accents and the lights\" (quoted in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, Catalogue of the Memorial Exhibition of the Works of the Late John Singer Sargent, exh. cat., 1925, text by J. Templeman Coolidge, p. ix). Following these tenets, Sargent built up the model\u2019s face by applying lights and darks to convey the sense of three-dimensionality, reserving the strokes of the brightest flesh tints for the nose and chin. Sargent\u2019s strokes are swift and sure, without concern for minute details or surface finishing. The shadowy light, reminiscent of Spanish painting, not only boldly contrasts the model\u2019s chest and face but softens the image.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",

      "curator notes" : "Arshile Gorky is known primarily for his canvases of the 1940s that revolutionized American painting and ultimately moved the New York School to the forefront of international trends. Lauded for his innovative mature works by such critics and authors as Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, and Robert Goldwater, Gorky underwent a long \"apprenticeship\" before developing his personal, transformative works of an Abstract Expressionist character. Jim Jordan, co-author of the Catalogue Raisonné of Gorky's paintings, has noted that study of the early paintings from Gorky's formative decades of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Still Life, circa 1928, \"revealed a number of unities through Gorky's entire oeuvre.\"Born Vosdanik Adoian in Armenia, the teenage Gorky arrived in the United States in 1920 and eventually settled in New York City in 1925, only a few years after starting to paint. The next fifteen years he virtually taught himself by experimenting and analyzing the modernist movements as espoused by Europeans during the first four decades of the twentieth century. In this respect, he was typical of many young American artists and students who looked to the Old World for inspiration. In a now often-cited 1926 New York Evening Post interview, Gorky referred to himself as a rebel protesting the provincialism of New York and praising the modern masters Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso. He went through a series of phases quickly absorbing the concepts of these modern Masters. His Self-Portrait, circa 1928, also owned by LACMA, is a synthesis of his response to Cezanne and Matisse, while Still Life, from the same period, is more fauve in character. Gorky does seem to be indebted to Cezanne and even Manet in the still life components \u2014 round fruit and slanting table knife \u2014 but Matisse's influence is particularly strong in the composition and the use of dark contour lines. Applying paint thickly and roughly, Gorky created a sparkling rich canvas despite the simplicity of the table-top arrangement. Moreover, the intense hues of citrus greens, warm roses and pinks, and deep cobalt blues \u2014 far more dynamic than in his Self Portrait \u2014 convey his fondness for color. It also offers a fascinating comparison with a later Gorky Still Life, circa 1936-1938, that LACMA also owns, in which the artist further developed a similar table-top still life motif into an synthetic cubist painting dominated by a limited palette with flat white planes and thick black outlines.Such modernist canvases a la Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso, were a ritual coming of age for most American art students, working both abroad and in the United States. This Matisse-like Still Life by Gorky along with his cubist Still Life as well as similar examples by Stanton Macdonald-Wright created in Paris and by Hugh Breckenridge painted in Philadelphia exemplify in LACMA's collection the course of early modernism in the United States.

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Randall Palmer was an itinerant portrait painter active during the 1820s and 1830s around Syracuse in western New York. Paintings such as The Young Artist, with its scale and complexity, indicate that he was far more accomplished than typical early provincial artists. Palmer excelled at meticulous details, here seen in the caned seat and veneer of the Empire chair and the patterned floor decoration. His instruction of several students may have inspired this painting. A young artist is shown seated before an easel, surrounded by the tools of the profession. A portfolio of prints on the floor behind his chair and a partly open book of landscapes show the sources used by the beginner, while the busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin \u2013 similar to works by the Philadelphia sculptor Benamin Rush \u2013 indicate another important field of artistic endeavor. This colorful folk image conveys the simplicity of most Americans, who still had a relatively unsophisticated lifestyle in rural areas.",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "In December 1889 Sargent returned to the United States, and, owing to his international fame, he was immediately deluged with requests for portraits by the best of New York and Boston society. Sargent spent the month of June 1890 in Worcester, Massachusetts, fulfilling a commission he had received several months earlier to paint the portrait of Mrs. Edward Livingston Davis. Maria Robbins Davis (1843-1916) came from a distinguished Boston family and, at the time of Sargent\u2019s portrait, was one of Worcester\u2019s most prominent women and the wife of a former mayor. The painting of Mrs. Davis with her son Livingston (1882-1932) was the most commanding and important of the portraits Sargent created in Worcester. Sargent used the Davises\u2019 stable for his studio because of its size and perhaps its empty black interior. In the portrait he avoided any allusions to the location and instead focused on the figures themselves, allowing their character and relationship to dominate. Sargent produced a complex psychological grouping in which the mother is contrasted with her child. Standing -- in the tradition of the formal, full-length portrait -- Mrs. Davis projects her upper-class breeding by her erect posture and frontal pose, yet she is also shown as a spirited woman and a mother of great warmth. While she and her son do not look at each other, they interact, albeit in a polite manner, through the tender grasp of hands and physical proximity The boy shyly leans toward his mother, and she responds by sheltering him with her left arm. In this and other family portraits Sargent masterfully avoided any sentimentality while sympathetically conveying his subjects\u2019 personalities. Sargent combined a dark palette with strong lighting, so that the overall effect is bright. Following the example of Carolus-Duran on close attention to values and the example of Spanish art, Sargent limited his palette largely to black and white while creating a colorful effect: there are subtle shifts from the cool blue-black of Mrs. Davis\u2019s dress to the warmer brown, black of the background, and touches of light blues in the shadows of the boy\u2019s sailor suit. Mrs. Davis and Her Son Livingston shows off Sargent\u2019s vigorous, fluid brushwork, most notably in the ruffles, fichu, and embroidery of Mrs. Davis\u2019s dress and the shadows of Livingston\u2019s suit. Sargent combined his handling with an assured manipulation of dramatic lighting to firmly model the figures. He created a psychologically penetrating portrait as well as a technical tour-de-force. Sargent\u2019s emulation of Spanish baroque painting is echoed in the faintly Spanish features of the portrait\u2019s original frame, designed by architect Stanford White.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997 John Singer Sargent was a truly international artist. Raised abroad, he spent most of his career painting the wealthy and famous of France, England, and the United States. In late 1889 he arrived in the United States to design murals for the Boston Public Library. The following June he spent in nearby Worcester, Massachusetts working on a portrait of the wife of the former mayor of the city, Edward Davis. This double portrait of Maria Davis and her small son Livingston was the largest and most commanding of his Worcester commissions. Sargent demonstrated his famed virtuosity with the brush, delineating the figures swiftly with assertive, sweeping strokes; the young boy\u2019s sailor suit is a mass of rippling light and shadows. The portrait is also a tour de force of black and white. Sargent posed the figures in the doorway of the Davis\u2019s carriage house in order to take advantage of its deep murky shadows. Despite the seeming neutrality of the palette and the formality of the portrait, the artist was able to convey the affection and warmth between mother and son. Surrounding the double portrait is an ornate frame by Stanford White. An eminent architect, White was also the leading frame designer of the era. Its opulence is in contrast to the starkness of the painting; although flat, the surface is completely covered with decorative elements \u2013 gadrooning (carved complex curves) as the inner edge and crossetted (projecting rectangular) corners combined with a weave pattern. This particular design was used to frame several of Sargent\u2019s other Worcester-period portraits.",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",

Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Memory is one of Vedder\u2019s most symbolic paintings. Although it at first appears to be a straightforward nocturnal view of the beach and ocean, upon close scrutiny one sees a faint human face emerge in the cloudy sky. Similar images of a floating head appear in a group of Vedder\u2019s drawings from the late 1860s. Later he would be fascinated by the related classical motif of the head of Medusa. The theme of floating and severed heads was popular with the English Pre-Raphaelites, and at the end of the century it became a characteristic motif of the symbolists. Artists used such imagery to suggest states of mind and ideas of a personal nature rather than to describe the material world.The art historian Regina Soria has identified two of the artist\u2019s drawings as bases for the museum\u2019s painting: The Face in the Clouds, 1866 (Wunderlich & Co., New York, as of 1987), which was illustrated in Vedder\u2019s autobiography The Digressions of V. (p. 287), and a small drawing done the next year with the title Memory inscribed on its original mat (LACMA, see illustration). As the 1867 drawing was executed on March 19, the birthday of Carrie Rosekrans, Vedder\u2019s fiancée at that time, it has been assumed that the head in the two drawings and the oil painting was that of Rosekrans. If the drawings were intended to be portraits of Rosekrans, they would have had to have been done from memory for she was not with Vedder at the times of their execution. Actually, it is difficult to ascertain either the sex or the age of the face in any of the three. The head may be that of a child. When Vedder painted Memory, Rosekrans was pregnant with their first child, and some seven years later he was commissioned by a Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Dumaresq to make a similar painting using the face of their recently deceased son.Will South has noted that at least one contemporary of Vedder\u2019s, English critic William Davies, referred to the head in the drawing Memory with the neuter \"it\" (Art Pictorial and Industrial: An Illustrated Magazine 1 [September 1870]: 49). In none of Vedder\u2019s own writings does he suggest a particular person or type as the model for the floating head. Perhaps the ambiguity of the sex and age of the head was intentional, for such imagery accords well with the artist\u2019s lifelong fascination with imaginative subjects and his enthusiasm for a sense of mystery.According to the artist\u2019s annotation of the 1866 drawing The Face in the Clouds, he was inspired to create such a meditative image by Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s poem, \"Break, Break, Break\" (published 1842), in which the poet contemplates the sea and broods over the memory of lost ones. In Vedder\u2019s painting the insubstantial, miragelike face, in contrast to the sharp reality of the shore and waves, suggests the transitory nature of life and the dreamlike quality of memory. In its quiet, mysterious mood the painting is quite evocative. The mauve palette and spectral quality of the night lighting also place Memory within the formal and conceptual tenets of late nineteenth-century symbolism. In fact, Memory ranks as one of the earliest symbolist images by an American.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "An American Oriental dates from the first years of du Bois\u2019s mature period and consequently is not completely characteristic of his later work. It was originally exhibited as New York Oriental, the term Oriental referring to a dark, exotic woman. The woman in this painting is not one of the fashionably dressed ladies du Bois usually depicted in his typical mature paintings but is a common, urban gypsy. In contrast to the two flappers depicted in Shops, 1922 (LACMA; q.v.), who also stand before a black, wrought-iron fence on a city street, this Oriental brazenly confronts the viewer with her direct gaze and open, frontal pose.Du Bois was a master of modern design. He conceived the Oriental as dark, shadowy, and fully modeled in contrast to the flat, brilliant orange brick wall she stands before and the gleaming white steps nearby. The scene is a slightly asymmetrical arrangement of three simplified areas of color held together by the iron fence. The woman\u2019s head is slightly cropped by the top of the canvas. In the late nineteenth century this compositional device became synonymous with contemporaneity; it does not, however, appear in du Bois\u2019s other paintings. The brick wall and adjoining door are painted in the highly saturated hues that became the hallmark of his paintings from the 1920s.",

      "label" : "An art critic as well as a painter, Guy Du Bois was the son of the noted critic Henri Pene De Bois and was at ease in literary and artistic circles. He recorded the Roaring Twenties by focusing on attractive young people and their chic clothes and lifestyle. As a student of Robert Henri he was thus following his teacher\u2019s insistence that he should depict his own era and environment. But in An American Oriental he practiced a more stringent, ashcan-school approach. The figure is not one of Du Bois\u2019s typical sleek modern figures, but a more curvaceous, earthy type. The term \u201cOriental\u201d at that time could refer to a member of numerous foreign ethnic groups; here it identifies the subject as one of the many recent immigrants to the United States. Her black hair, wide dark eyes, and full lips suggest that she might be an Italian, a Jew, or a Gypsy. Her plain blouse and skirt confirm her status as a working-class woman.Du Bois presents her in a confrontational manner and on a larger scale than his usual figures. Her hands clutch the railing behind her, so that nothing obstructs our view of her body. Staring out at the viewer she seems far from shy or reticent. Du Bois has cropped her head at the top of the canvas, a compositional device used by the impressionists to convey the immediacy of contemporary life. Attitudes toward immigrants varied, but the artist seems to suggest that these new Americans could not be ignored.",

      "about the era" : "Until 1893, when historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the western frontier closed, the nation had perceived itself as an ever-expanding geographical entity. The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John O\u2019Sullivan coined the term \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1895 Hudson painted Powley\u2019s Sweetheart (unlocated). Supposedly enough viewers of the painting asked, \"Who\u2019s Powley?\" that in response Hudson painted this picture of Powley, a young Pomo Indian who worked for white settlers, helping them plant corn, hops, and other crops. Hudson carefully detailed Powley as he stood at rest in a field of corn. Despite her provincial training, Hudson was proficient at drafting and at her best excelled in the academic rendering of the figure, as in this painting. Powley, on the verge of manhood, is a chubby, handsome boy, his dark, smooth skin and eyes standing out before the soft yellow field of corn surrounding him. Powley satisfied the late nineteenth-century taste for a sentimental and saccharine portrayal of innocence, as did the paintings of street urchins by Hudson\u2019s urban counterpart, John G. Brown (1831-1913). Powley\u2019s life, however, did not fulfill this ideal. His success as a performer in a tourist attraction led him to abandon traditional ways, change his name to Jeff Dick, and neglect his wife and child. Eventually he became an alcoholic, killed a man, and died of syphilis (Ukiah, The Sun House and Grace Hudson Museum, Grace Hudson Papers, \"The Rise and Fall of Powley,\" manuscript). Hudson left a diary in which she listed her paintings chronologically and assigned them numbers. Entitled Indian Boy with Hoe when it was donated to the museum, the painting was later correctly identified by the number \"43\" written on its verso.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "Mark created several paintings expressing his horror and anger over the atrocities inflicted by the Japanese on the Chinese when they invaded the mainland in 1937. The artist read newspaper accounts of the war, and Execution may have been directly inspired by newspaper photographs or motion-picture newsreels. Bound Man, 1939 (Smithsonian American Art Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), and Execution are concerned with the brutal killing of defenseless victims and reveal Mark\u2019s spiritual debt to Francisco Goya (1746-1828). Mark conveyed the brutality of murder by his forceful brushstrokes, inspired by the surfaces and thick muscular style of Mexican muralists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896-1974). In Execution the entire image points to the unseen murderer. What appears to be several bodies is actually only one man, who, in the agony of excruciating pain and death, gyrates from side to side until he collapses to the ground. The man\u2019s constricted, bound body has been compressed into the shape of a sack. Human life had become worthless; as if to suggest that the victim has lost his humanity, Mark portrayed him faceless, devoid of any individuality. Such treatment also suggests that Mark intended this image to have universal application, a pictorial condemnation of all inhuman barbarism.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Elliott\u2019s work progressed through several stylistic phases. He first painted in general imitation of GILBERT STUART. While in New York during the 1840s he sought a rich, romantic style. In the 1850s and 1860s Elliott worked in the style most distinctively his own, one of firm and frank realism to some extent shaped by the development of photographic portraiture. With its plain background setting and distinct plastic figure, the museum\u2019s portrait of an unknown gentleman is characteristic of Elliott\u2019s full realist style. Elliott was thought to be best in his portraits of men particularly, as observed by Tuckerman (1867, p. 300), when the sitters have \"strong, practical natures,\" as this one seems to have.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "Early in his career Smith exhibited landscape, still-life, and genre paintings in addition to portraits, but he met with such success as a portraitist after moving to the Midwest that he seldom painted any other subject. He appears to have received almost all of the most important portrait commissions in the Midwestern cities where he worked. Nevertheless, he exhibited genre paintings at the National Academy of Design in 1842 and with the American Art-Union in 1846 and 1848-49. The Young Mechanic, his Art-Union painting for 1848, is the first of these efforts to come to light. Its warm tonality, strong lighting, and detailed realism accord with the artist\u2019s portrait style during the period. The thoroughgoing realism is epitomized in the trompe l\u2019oeil feature of the gate that extends forward toward the picture plane and which bears Smith\u2019s signature. His attention to detail and textures seems almost obsessive, even in the context of Midwestern taste as displayed in the realism of Cincinnati\u2019s Lilly Martin Spencer (1822-1902) and JAMES H. BEARD early in the following decade. Smith\u2019s is a frank realism of wear, stains, and clutter, held together by a strong architectural framework. The title, The Young Mechanic (the word mechanic meaning a skilled person who works with his hands), refers to the boy seated behind the counter of what may be his father\u2019s woodworking shop. The working-class boy has been hired by the better-dressed boy in the straw hat to whittle a new mast for his toy boat.",

      "label" : "Although Allen Smith Jr. was a well-known portrait painter in the Midwest, he trained and occasionally exhibited in New York City. He also created still lifes, landscapes, and genre scenes of everyday life, such as The Young Mechanic. (The term \u201cmechanic\u201d here refers to a skilled manual laborer.) The image of a craftsman was a popular theme in American figure painting throughout the nineteenth century. This scene is unusual, in that children rather than adults convey the narrative. They appear to be in negotiation, the well-dressed boy with a straw hat hiring the seated lad to whittle a new mast for his toy ship. The interplay between the two protagonists is highlighted by their different social classes. This picture was painted in Cleveland when economic and social conditions were changing in that city. As the local economy shifted away from manual skills, efforts to improve the life of laborers were initiated by the founding of a mechanics\u2019 lyceum in the early 1840s.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "This painting came to the museum with no title but has been called The Wanderer because of its subject matter. The image of the Wandering Jew in art dates back several centuries and took on many levels of meaning, often referring to a person on the fringes of or outside of society. Sigall, who may have been Jewish, might have intended this elderly man to allude to his own emigrations. However, the wanderer was quite an appropriate subject during the Great Depression, during which thousands of people were displaced, some of them forced to live as hobos. In this painting Sigall has presented in quite sympathetic terms an old man who stops to rest and contemplate his situation. A tear stands on his eyelid. Although the background does not seem to be the depiction of a specific locale, the remnants of the front page of a Los Angeles Times in the immediate foreground place the wanderer in the Southern California area.The picture\u2019s somewhat piecemeal nature gives it a rather naïve quality, but Sigall\u2019s meticulously detailed rendering and application of paint in a tempera technique suggest that he was trained in traditional old master methods. Such realistic depiction accords with the revival of Renaissance art that was occurring in American painting at the time. Whether Sigall encountered such art through studies in Europe, South America, or the United States is not known.",

      "curator notes" : "In 1936, Edward Biberman moved from New York City to Los Angeles. He is best known for later paintings such as LACMA\u2019s The White Fire Escape. Such urban scenes reveal his affinity for the seemingly mundane details of midcentury modern architecture, which he illuminated through his attention to the light, shadow, and geometry of both subject matter and composition. But throughout his career he created important figurative paintings of labor, social struggle and political tension, such as LACMA\u2019s Conspiracy (1955), as well as significant portraiture. His portraits of African American cultural and political leaders are especially noteworthy: he created a monumental portrait of Paul Robeson, and his Lena Horne is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery where it has graced enormous banners on their façade. Biberman is an important, if long overlooked, Los Angeles artist that the American and Modern departments at LACMA are focusing on building a collection of his art through gift and purchase. I Had a Dream, painted in 1968, was created in response to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King and is unique for Biberman in that it zooms in on the civil rights leader\u2019s face. Though we see only Dr. King\u2019s eyes, nose and mustache, his iconic features are instantly recognizable. The searing intensity of his gaze is steadfast and visionary. The American Art department looks for such portraiture with which our diverse audiences can identify. A large and powerful painting like I Had a Dream not only represents one of the most important figures of the twentieth century but demonstrates the devastating impact of his death on all Americans and can remind us of the significance of his legacy today.

In many respects the American colonies functioned like an English province. Culturally they were largely British; from interior design and dress to painted portraits, wealthy colonists emulated the London fashions of the period. However, there was often a time lag, as examples of the finest British furniture, household goods, and decorative items such as paintings had to be transported across the ocean. At first the only trained artists and artisans in the colonies were emigrants from London who thought fame would be easier to achieve in the less competitive atmosphere of Boston or Philadelphia. By the end of the eighteenth century, this traffic had reversed somewhat, as American artists went to London for their training. Portraits were the most popular genre, since British citizens everywhere wanted visual records of their families and heroes. Historical and literary subjects, such as those by Benjamin West, were usually only painted in London; their appreciation required a more educated audience than was the case with many colonists. The pervasive influence of Britain would continue to affect the development of culture in the United States long after the Revolutionary War had severed the Crown\u2019s political authority.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Before settling in New England for a decade (1753-63), Joseph Blackburn visited Bermuda, which had come under British domination in 1684 and was closely connected to the American mainland by trade routes. Here he painted at least seventeen portraits, seven devoted to the members of the family of Francis Jones, governor of the colony. Fannie, Francis Jones\u2019s daughter, married Captain John Pigott by, a customs collector, in 1745. The British considered Bermuda an exotic locale, as Blackburn shows in this portrait of Mrs. Pigott by posing her in front of a palmetto with a small native bird perched on her finger. This painting, along with the one of John Pigott to the right, remained in the Jones family until acquired by the museum; consequently, the frames are original eighteenth-century examples of the English rococo aesthetic, with sand panels and lacy, open carving decorated with fine and floret details.",

      "curator notes" : "Henry Inman\u2019s portrait of No-Tin illuminates the integral place of American Indians in the nation\u2019s history and art history. Painted after a lost original by Charles Bird King, Inman\u2019s portrait of No-Tin is an early and defining example of American artists\u2019 efforts, pre-photography, to depict Native Americans for national posterity. The portrait is also a testament to a critical moment in the history of Native Americans.Because Inman\u2019s portrait survives, we know that No-Tin, which means Wind, was a Chippewa chief who came with his tribe\u2019s delegation to Washington DC in the mid-1820s. Nothing is known of No-Tin\u2019s own experiences during that visit, but he was one of scores of tribal leaders invited to the capitol by the U.S. government for negotiations, tours, and an audience with the President. The Chiefs would stay for several weeks, even months, for meetings and to experience Anglo American culture, all part of a federal diplomatic effort to pave the way for Indian removal and westward expansion.This mission was cultivated most influentially by Thomas L. McKenney, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a division of the U.S. Department of War. McKenney had also made it his mission to collect and preserve Native American materials for a national collection. But it was the Indian delegations that inspired McKenney to add portraits to his collection and create a national Indian Gallery. In 1822, he commissioned King, a Washington DC portraitist, to capture their faces. The project was an attempt to produce visual documents that might represent and preserve the power he knew these Chiefs would soon lose.The Chippewa, a corruption of the tribe name Ojibwa, were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the Great Lakes territory and had extensive influence in the European fur trade. They controlled ore-rich, forested lands which they were largely able to protect\u2014until 1837. In fact, No-Tin has been cited for his attempt to improve the conditions at Fort Snelling, in what is now Minnesota, where the Chippewa had to negotiate that 1837 treaty. No-Tin implored that the federal agents to provide better food rations, specifically more beef, for the tribe as they prepared to negotiate the inevitable cession of their lands: \"You have everything around you, and can give us some of the cattle that are around us on the prairie.\"King\u2019s picture of No-Tin and over 130 other Indian Chiefs were all on permanent display to the public in the War Department offices, a major feature of all travel accounts and guides to the capitol. The passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830 further encouraged McKenney to make the portraits in the Indian Gallery as widely available to the public as possible. He knew that only a successful artist, one more accomplished and ambitious than King, could produce the kind of compelling paintings that would become well known outside Washington. That artist was Henry Inman.Inman is among the best American artists of the early-nineteenth century. He established his studio in New York in 1824, quickly building his reputation as one of the most sought-after portraitists of his day, at a time when portraiture dominated artistic activity. Inman regularly received coveted commissions from the government and from the nation\u2019s leading families. The Inman versions of the Indian portraits are original works of art in their own right. Such paintings reference a long and proud art historical tradition of copying masterpieces, as well as give us a unique perspective on lost originals. King\u2019s originals were small records of his sitters. Inman enlarged the size of his canvases to make an artistic statement. Inman\u2019s decision to increase the scale not only enhanced the significance of his paintings but also of each Chief. His large portraits deliberately put the Indian sitters on par with his renowned paintings of other prominent Americans. Inman\u2019s portraits attained even greater significance after King\u2019s portraits were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s art gallery, which burned in 1865, destroying all of King\u2019s originals, including No-Tin.Inman\u2019s portrait of No-Tin is in its original frame, and Inman beautifully painted No-Tin\u2019s Chippewa costume details, such as the pink ostrich plume, the customized eagle feather, bead choker and orange and white face paint, decorations that would have been worn for special occasions\u2014especially a diplomatic visit, or a portrait sitting, in Washington. No-Tin is wrapped elegantly in a green, possibly felt, blanket, the likes of which were commonly traded. His character is conveyed especially through his direct and steady gaze.Inman\u2019s art has prevented No-Tin from being lost to history. This rare portrait represents the inextricable place of American Indians in our national story, an essential perspective previously missing from LACMA\u2019s presentation of American art. Now LACMA comprehensively represents the diverse faces of early America.Austen Bailly, Assitant Curator, American Art, (2008)",

      "about the era" : "The late nineteenth century witnessed a growing cosmopolitanism and sophistication in American culture. Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patrons\u2019 importance in full-length portraits. Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this \u201cnew painting\u201d was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.",
      "curator notes" : "While living in Cullercoats in 1881-82, Homer reinterpreted the popular image of women anxiously searching the stormy North Sea for their loved ones. Quite unlike those heroic figures are the diminutive silhouettes in the museum\u2019s painting, who very well may represent the summer visitors from the nearby hotels whom Homer and his family are known to have joined on at least one occasion as they watched the moonlit sea on the rocks near Homer\u2019s home and studio at Prout\u2019s Neck, Maine. On that occasion, the artist left the group, completing on the porch of his studio the charcoal drawing that formed the basis of his painting A Summer Night, 1890 (Musée d'Orsay, Paris), in which the figure at left in the museum\u2019s painting seems to appear. Like the watercolor A Moonlit Sea, 1890 (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford), the museum\u2019s painting may be a study for A Summer Night; or it may be an independent work of years earlier, related to the watercolor, Northeaster, dated 1883 (Brooklyn Museum), a daylight scene in which two women in tam-o\u2019-shanter and round bonnet watch the sea from the rocks (although their positions are reversed). It can also be related to the painting Moonlight, Wood Island Light, 1894 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), because of the exceptionally bold technique of both paintings. According to the art historian William Downes, that picture was painted in 1894 during an impulsive four or five hours\u2019 work one night, entirely by moonlight, a seemingly impossible illumination for judging colors. Because of its exceptionally free technique, the museum\u2019s painting is difficult to date on the basis of style. The connection with the works of 1890 seems most persuasive. For Homer, the moonlit sea was a recurring romantic theme in which the otherwise threatening sea seems tamed and charmed. The violence of the sea in Moonlight on the Water is somewhat unusual within this group. On the back of the painting the artist\u2019s brother Charles, his executor, indicated the date 1906, a period when Homer was known to have begun no new pictures, only repainting old ones. While there is no evidence of repainting on the picture\u2019s present surface, it may have been at this time that Homer restretched the painting, greatly changing its proportions by folding portions of the painting back around the stretcher at the top and sides to give it its present, unusually elongated shape. In adopting this format, Homer may have meant to accentuate the characteristics of the painting that relate to the Japanese prints he admired -- the theme of the great wave, diagonal compositional elements, silhouetted figures, and strong surface design.",

      "label" : "An art critic as well as a painter, Guy Du Bois was the son of the noted critic Henri Pene De Bois and was at ease in literary and artistic circles. He recorded the Roaring Twenties by focusing on attractive young people and their chic clothes and lifestyle. As a student of Robert Henri he was thus following his teacher\u2019s insistence that he should depict his own era and environment. But in An American Oriental he practiced a more stringent, ashcan-school approach. The figure is not one of Du Bois\u2019s typical sleek modern figures, but a more curvaceous, earthy type. The term \u201cOriental\u201d at that time could refer to a member of numerous foreign ethnic groups; here it identifies the subject as one of the many recent immigrants to the United States. Her black hair, wide dark eyes, and full lips suggest that she might be an Italian, a Jew, or a Gypsy. Her plain blouse and skirt confirm her status as a working-class woman.Du Bois presents her in a confrontational manner and on a larger scale than his usual figures. Her hands clutch the railing behind her, so that nothing obstructs our view of her body. Staring out at the viewer she seems far from shy or reticent. Du Bois has cropped her head at the top of the canvas, a compositional device used by the impressionists to convey the immediacy of contemporary life. Attitudes toward immigrants varied, but the artist seems to suggest that these new Americans could not be ignored.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "The artist\u2019s record book indicates the title of this painting is Pepita, and it notes elsewhere that it was painted in Santa Fe.While summering in La Jolla, California, in 1914, Henri planned the art exhibition at San Diego\u2019s Panama-California International Exposition (1915) and became close friends with Dr. Edgar L. Hewett, an ethnologist and director of the School of American Archaeology in Santa Fe, who was in charge of the ethnology and art exhibits. At Dr. Hewett\u2019s invitation Henri spent the summers of 1916, 1917, and 1922 in Santa Fe, where Hewett introduced him to the Native Americans and their cultures. Henri\u2019s ethnological interest in them fits into the larger pattern of his traveling in search of national or ethnic types, such as his Irish, Chinese, and black subjects. In his paintings of Native Americans he paid attention to costumes and daily habits while attempting to convey the spirit of the people, which he saw as noble and mysterious. For this purpose he preferred to paint children rather than adults, saying in The Art Spirit, \"I have never respected any man more than I have some children. In the faces of children I have seen a look of wisdom and of kindness expressed with such ease and such certainty that I knew it was the expression of a whole race\" (p. 242). The word Pepita simply means \"little girl\"; Henri\u2019s record book indicates that the model\u2019s name was Juanita.Several of Henri\u2019s paintings of Native Americans include geometric blankets as backgrounds, perhaps reflecting his growing consciousness of abstract art and surface structure. Pepita\u2019s multicolored background may refer to such textiles. Henri advised in The Art Spirit: \"If there are objects in the background, they must not be painted because they are interesting in themselves. Their only right of existence is a complementary of harmonic benefits to the head of the figure\" (p. 35).William Preston Harrison bought Pepita upon the suggestion of GEORGE BELLOWS, an artist the collector much admired.",

      "about the era" : "Four years after the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, a program of domestic reform meant to revive the economy and alleviate the problem of mass unemployment. Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism. Artists who were accustomed to working in their studios now looked beyond their immediate circles for models. Individuals of various races, professions, or creeds inspired some of the most moving portraits of the century and demonstrated the soul of the people.",
      "curator notes" : "Coney Island was the first painting Cadmus made after he ceased working for the federally sponsored Public Works of Art Project. It is typical of his paintings of the period in both theme and form.Cadmus viewed the prosaic activity of bathing on a beach in devastatingly satirical terms. Poking fun at the bathers\u2019 carefree pleasures, Cadmus accumulated an odd assortment of bulging, burnt bodies. The bathers are oblivious to their ridiculous appearance and uncouth behavior. Swarming the beach, their bodies are strangely intertwined, their faces smiling inanely. Everything is exaggerated, the color verging on the garish to intensify their grossness.In the 1930s Cadmus used oil paint almost as if it were a graphic medium, consequently Coney Island looks more like a tinted drawing than a painting. His small, exacting brushstrokes impart a flickering quality to the surface, which intensifies the impression that the figures are in constant motion.Cadmus actually began to sketch the scene on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, before he visited Coney Island. He was attracted to the Brooklyn beach because it offered him the opportunity to delineate the human figure with as little clothing as possible. Moreover, he considered the beach scene to be a classical subject. His treatment, however, is rather baroque. As was his friend REGINALD MARSH, Cadmus was attracted to the elaborate compositions of old master paintings. Coney Island, with its seminude figures arranged in complex groupings, their bodies twisted and in constant motion, was for Cadmus the twentieth-century version of a baroque allegorical composition.Cadmus claimed that his intent was not to be sensational, but when the painting was exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s second biennial, it suffered the same hostile reception as did his earlier The Fleet\u2019s In!. The Coney Island Showmen\u2019s League, a local trade group, denounced the painting as offensive and inaccurate and threatened a libel suit if the painting was not removed from the exhibition. According to the artist\u2019s incomplete records, it seems that the painting was rejected from several annual exhibitions to which it was submitted soon after it was shown at the Whitney biennial, probably because of the controversy it stirred.In 1935 Cadmus produced an etching from a photograph of the painting in the hope that it would reach a larger public. In the etching the image is reversed but otherwise differs only in a few minor details (see Related Works).",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Cadmus was one of the most controversial American artists of the 1930s. His satirical perspective made people uncomfortable, and consequently reviewers sometimes questioned the decency of his rollicking scenes of New York City life. Coney Island, with its amusement park and beach on the south shore of Brooklyn, was a favorite destination of working-class people. Rather than glamorize laborers enjoying their day off, Cadmus poked fun at these beachgoers and their bulging, entangled bodies. They seem oblivious to their sunburnt flesh and the silliness of their activities. Coney Island met a particularly hostile reception when it was first exhibited. A businessman organization associated with the amusement park denounced the painting as offensive, resulting in its rejection from subsequent exhibitions. Cadmus\u2019s meticulous painting technique \u2013 pigments applied with thin, pencil like strokes \u2013 enabled him to delineate minute detail. For example, the viewer can read the headline about Hitler in the newspaper held by the reclining man in the foreground. This subtle reference to the horrifying political developments abroad underscores the inanities of the beachgoers.Carved in wood, this simple frame was rubbed with pigment rather than gilded, a treatment that came into fashion during World War I, as gold became scarce.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "During the period 1874-76 Homer returned for visits to Petersburg, Virginia, where, as a correspondent illustrator, he had spent time during the final siege of the Civil War. There, he made studies for and may have painted a series of watercolors and paintings of the life of rural African Americans. Critics hailed him as the first artist to have seen the possibilities of this untapped subject matter. These paintings are exceptional for their realism and sensitive treatment of their subjects, in contrast to the caricatured portrayals Homer had joined others in painting during and after the Civil War period. The Cotton Pickers is quite simply the artist\u2019s most monumental painting of the figure; that it should also be of African American subjects is remarkable. In painting rural workers in such heroic terms, Homer was no doubt drawing upon a tradition well-developed in various European countries by 1876, perhaps best known today in the work of Jean-Franqois Millet (1814-1875) and Jules Breton (1827-1906). Like them, Homer painted his rural workers as graceful majestic figures, but he chose unmistakably American subject matter. Homer brought the same respect and sympathy the French artists had for their nation\u2019s peasants to bear on his representations of African Americans. Presented from a low vantage point, these powerful figures fill the canvas and dominate the composition. They are also portrayed as individuals, the figure on the right gazing into the distance, a particularly poignant image of inner life and of aspiration. The Cotton Pickers was the climax of Homer\u2019s early figural style, and one of his most profoundly original works.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Traditionally Winslow Homer has been cast as a shy loner, working in relative isolation. However, his paintings from the Civil War to 1880 were anything but devoid of social content. The group of paintings of African Americans that he produced in the 1870s, of which The Cotton Pickers is the most important, resonate with political meaning. Homer was the first American consistently to paint African Americans without the prevailing attitudes of condescension and sentimentality. The date of this painting sheds light on its significance. Not only was 1876 the year of the country\u2019s Centennial: more importantly for blacks it also marked the end of Reconstruction, as federal troops withdrew from the south. The Reconstruction era had been buoyed by hopes that the situation of former slaves would be drastically improved as they were freed and educated. Unfortunately that idealism was to be short-lived, as racism and bigotry emerged with vehemence. Homer still evinces the earlier hopefulness in his commanding painting of two female field laborers. His portrayal is sympathetic and positive: they are not being over or fatigued but rather stand erect, their strong bodies monumentalized against the sky. The woman on the right looks far into the distance, dreaming of a better future.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "When Kroll returned from Paris in 1914 he began painting images of New York City, depicting the life of its crowded streets, bridges, and waterfront. He continued to paint such images until about 1917. The scenes were very well received when exhibited throughout the country. Collector William Preston Harrison may have decided to buy one of Kroll\u2019s New York scenes after seeing several exhibited in annuals of the Art Institute of Chicago. Kroll painted at least four canvases of the Forty-second Street and Broadway area, three of them in 1916. While two include a bit of Bryant Park, in this version Kroll omitted the park and any glimpse of nature. He focused on the skyscrapers that were then drastically changing the skyline of New York. As in most of his urban scenes, Kroll captured the energy and congestion of the metropolis by depicting the streets crowded with trolleys and pedestrians.New York was not a dark, dingy place to Kroll. This painting is in a high-keyed blue palette. Although not documented as being an enthusiastic disciple of Hardesty Maratta\u2019s color theory, as was his close friend GEORGE BELLOWS, Kroll may have been stimulated to use such an intense hue by the general interest in color then prevalent among artists. The cool hue suggests the cold of winter, and Kroll is known to have painted many Manhattan snow scenes. The artist would go to any extreme, painting outdoors or even hanging from windows, to capture a sense of the city. The intense palette was equaled by the bold brushwork that characterizes most of Kroll\u2019s New York paintings.",

      "about the era" : "After the centennial of 1876 the foremost place for American artists to show was no longer New York but Paris. By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artist\u2019s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung \u201con the line\u201d (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintings\u2014narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark palette\u2014as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Tanner first achieved recognition at the Paris Salon of 1896 with his painting Daniel in the Lions\u2019 Den. Although the museum\u2019s painting of the same title has been often mistaken for the painting shown in the 1896 Salon, it is a similar, but later version. In both paintings Tanner delineated an Old Testament story set during the reign of King Darius in ancient Persia (Dan. 6:16-24). Tanner infused the drama of Daniel\u2019s unjust imprisonment with a quiet spirituality. The earlier canvas was Tanner\u2019s first major religious painting and indicated the direction that his art would take. The choice of a religious subject may have been inspired initially by his teacher Laurens, who was noted for dramatic biblical paintings. Tanner\u2019s depiction of a dark prison cell, dramatically lit by evening light streaming through a high window, may have also come from Laurens, whose Le Grand Inquisiteur chez les rois catholiques, 1886 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) -- a painting also about an unjust imprisonment -- is similar in composition and lighting. It is probably not coincidental that Tanner owned a reproduction of the Laurens painting and kept it throughout his career (it is among the Tanner Papers). The decision to select a narrative in which animals play a major role may have been determined by Tanner\u2019s previous success with animal paintings; he had sold Lions at Home, by 1885 (unlocated), when it was exhibited in 1885 at the National Academy of Design. When he decided to paint this subject he prepared himself by sketching the lions at the Jardins des Plants and by studying with the noted animalier Emmanuel Frémiet. Tanner often painted variations on the same theme. The museum\u2019s version was probably executed in the years before the First World War, possibly as early as 1907. Tanner exhibited a painting entitled Daniel in the Lions\u2019 Den at the annual of the Pennsylvania Academy in 1896-97, at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 in Saint Louis, his 1908 show at the American Art Galleries in New York, and the Anglo-American Exposition in London in 1914. It was probably the second version that was exhibited in the last two, however, none of the descriptions in the reviews of any of these exhibitions is specific enough for determining which version was shown. Although the museum\u2019s painting is on paper, it probably was not intended as a sketch but as an independent, second version. (In 1976 the canvas used to back the museum\u2019s painting was found to have on it an unfinished oil possibly illustrating a scene from the life of Job and able to be dated on stylistic grounds to the late 1890s or early years of the 1900s.) The museum\u2019s painting is a recapitulation of the scene as Tanner depicted it in his 1896 Salon painting, but he changed the format and modified details. The earlier Daniel in the Lions\u2019 Den was a vertical painting in which half the composition was taken up by the shadowy, high-ceilinged structure above the head of Daniel. In the second version, Tanner eliminated the ceiling to focus more on the figure. Both paintings emphasized shadows, with a brilliant light illuminating the lower half of Daniel\u2019s figure, especially his bound hands. While the shape and size of the illuminated area were altered in the second version -- to show more of the prisoner\u2019s figure -- the change was not significant. The first version included an elaborate Assyrian frieze. Although such details were in keeping with the late nineteenth-century academic taste for archaeological accuracy and narration, they did not accord with Tanner\u2019s mature painting style. During the first decade of this century Tanner developed a poetic style in which he used color and light to evoke the essence of a religious story. In the museum\u2019s painting Daniel appears calm, strengthened by his inner spiritual belief, and Tanner\u2019s use of a bluegreen palette heightened this meditative mood. Experiments with pigments and glazing begun around 1907 enabled him to infuse his art with a soft, glowing light and shimmering color. While the overall color scheme of Daniel in the Lions\u2019 Den is tonal -- typical of Tanner\u2019s mature canvases -- the painting actually is much more varied in color than it initially appears, for the lions are sketched in brilliant shades of yellow, green, and lavender.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",

      "about the era" : "After the Jacksonian presidency (1829\u201337), the adolescent country began an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion, exemplified by the success of the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348). Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The war\u2019s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose. Although Winslow Homer became the quintessential Yankee painter, with his representations of country life during the reconstruction era, European aesthetics began to infiltrate taste.",
      "curator notes" : "Leutze returned to this country from Düsseldorf in September 1851 to be present during the exhibition in New York and Washington of his phenomenally successful showpiece Washington Crossing the Delaware. By February 1852, working in his New York studio, he had begun Mrs. Schuyler Burning Her Wheat Fields on the Approach of the British. It was to be the second of some dozen subjects from the Revolutionary War that he was to paint, capitalizing on the fact that the sensational response to his Washington Crossing the Delaware was henceforth to link his name with such subject matter. Patriotic feelings stirred by the Mexican American War had already inspired patronage for other artists\u2019 efforts on such themes.Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler (1734-1803), wife of General Philip Schuyler, is shown setting fire to her wheat fields to keep them from the enemy, whose imminent arrival is announced by a messenger. The first account of this act of heroism to appear in print was a passage in the chapter on Mrs. Schuyler in Elizabeth F. Ellet\u2019s The Women of the American Revolution (1848), one of the many anthologies of Revolutionary War feminine heroism popular during the period. It was based on the account of Mrs. Schuyler written in 1846 by Catherine Van Rensselaer Cochrane, Mrs. Schuyler\u2019s youngest daughter. Surviving documents do not support this family tradition, however. Although General Schuyler pursued a scorched-earth policy and Mrs. Schuyler traveled twice to the estate to pack furnishings during July 1777, the British under John Burgoyne arrived at Saratoga (now called Schuylerville) on September 13 to find the large plantation virtually intact.The painting reflects the skillful history painting tradition of Düsseldorf in its clearly subordinated composition and use of antique sculptural models for two of the figures.Leutze\u2019s freedom in adding genrelike secondary activity of his own invention is balanced by his efforts to obtain an accurate portrayal of Mrs. Schuyler by studying a portrait in the family\u2019s possession (probably one now in the New-York Historical Society). Leutze\u2019s reputation as an outstanding colorist is supported by the painting\u2019s rich harmonies.",

      "label" : "Exhibition Label, 1997Emanuel Leutze is most often identified with his Washington Crossing the Delaware (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), perhaps the most famous depiction of the American Revolution. Leutze created that historical painting in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1851, then returned to his adopted country to exhibit it. During his stay the artist decided to capitalize on the success of the painting by initiating a series based on events of the war. The second was Mrs. Schuyler Burning Her Wheat Fields on the Approach of the British. Like George Washington, Mrs. Schuyler was a legendary hero whose accomplishments had become folklore by mid-century. Catherine Schuyler was the wife of General Philip Schuyler, who advocated a scorched-earth policy toward the British. According to family tradition (later proved false), when British troops advanced on the Schuyler\u2019s summer estate in Saratoga, New York, she decided to torch her fields rather than allow the enemy to seize the wheat. Leutze conceived the narrative as a theatrical scene, with Mrs. Schuyler center state. By presenting her in a red, white, and blue gown Leutze not only revealed his skill as a colorist but also underscored Mrs. Schuyler\u2019s patriotic deed.The frame is an excellent example of the fluted cove design that became popular in the 1860s.",

      "about the era" : "The art of the early Federal period did not greatly differ from that of the late colonial era. Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: \u201cour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.\u201d The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre pictures\u2014scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activities\u2014seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. This period also saw the rise of the country\u2019s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.",
      "curator notes" : "In 1817 James William Wallack, actor and theatrical producer, married actress Susan Johnstone, who was daughter of John Henry Johnstone (known as Irish Johnstone, a singer, comedian, and member of the circle of the Prince of Wales). She enjoyed successful comic roles using her maiden name. In 1818 and frequently after that she came to New York with her husband. Of their four sons, the eldest, John Johnstone Wallack, known as Lester Wallack, was also an actor, as was his second son, Arthur. Mrs. Wallack died in 1851.Like his contemporary THOMAS SULLY, Henry Inman painted several portraits of theatrical figures. Sully exhibited a Portrait of Mrs. Wallack at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1819. Inman painted a full-length-in-small of James William Wallack (unlocated), portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Wallack (both unlocated) that he exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1828, and yet another portrait of Mrs. Wallack, n.d. (Museum of the City of New York). Hair and costume styles indicate that the museum\u2019s portrait was painted about 1828 and the portrait in the collection of the Museum of the City of New York much later. In both portraits of Mrs. Wallack one can see the full romantic style that won for Inman the title \"the American Lawrence.\"",

      "about the era" : "The beginning of every century inspires a general sentiment of endless possibilities, and the twentieth century was no exception. A modern age marked by technological wonders had begun, and the United States was to be its focal point. Lewis Mumford, one of the country\u2019s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, \u201cthe New World expanded the human imagination.\u201d Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freud\u2019s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.",

      "about the era" : "The early twentieth century witnessed the transformation of the United States into a modern industrialized society and an international political power. By 1920 more than half of the country\u2019s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affected\u2014the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city.Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and Post-Impressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts.In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the \u201cAsh Can School\u201d because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. These artists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led them to create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.",
      "curator notes" : "In a Pensive Mood is typical of Philipp\u2019s figure studies in theme and composition. Often he portrayed a thoughtful, attractive young woman seated at a table on which is arranged a still-life composition. During the 1930s he was much influenced by impressionism and postimpressionism. The compressed sense of space and the placement of the figure off to the side, balanced by the bouquet of chrysanthemums and daisies, is reminiscent of the art of Degas, while Philipp\u2019s slightly textured, soft surface has been compared with that of Renoir. Placing the table on a diagonal was one of Philipp\u2019s favorite compositional devices.This painting was singled out as one of the best in Philipp\u2019s second solo exhibition at the Grand Central Galleries in New York in 1935. His handling of color and glowing, sensuous flesh tones were highly praised. Philipp was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design as a result of his showing In a Pensive Mood at its 1935 annual.",

      "curator notes" : "Lavinia Fontana was one of the most successful female artists of the Renaissance whose practice centered on portraits of the aristocratic citizens of her native Bologna. Unusually for a woman, her work also included religious and mythological subjects. She was born into an artistic family in 1552. Her father, Prospero Fontana (1512-1597) was an enlightened Mannerist painter known as much for his paintings, many of which betray his apprenticeship under Vasari, as for his passion for literature and his taste for antiques which he collected. Lavinia\u2019s early education took place in this refined milieu. Rapidly she was able to negotiate the complicated paths and obstacles set in front of her: as a woman she learned how to navigate the complexities of personal rank, as well as admittance by peers, connoisseurs and dealers. Devout, she married and had many children: she was proud of being an exemplary mother while gaining recognition and even popularity. Her fame reached Rome. In 1604, Pope Clement VII called her there. Her later years in Rome were marked by success as well. This fine \u201cSacra Conversazione\u201d ranks among the most accomplished works of the painter. Its softness \u2013 which owes much to both Raphael and Correggio, sets it apart from many of her paintings in which the artist continues the decorative and somewhat stiff manner of her father. Indeed this may have had to do with Lavinia\u2019s intention to participate in the Counter Reformation movement and to follow carefully the suggestions of the Bolognese Cardinal Paleotti (1522 1597) whose treatise Discorso intorno alle immagini sacre e profane (1592) was a manual intended to explain the clarity and simplicity required by the Council of Trent in the treatment of religious images. Here Lavinia clearly attempts to reform the Mannerist tradition and to introduce through emotional interaction and expressive gestures the kind of art capable of \u201cmoving the spirit\u201d recommended by Cardinal Paleotti.

      "curator notes" : "Wilhelm Trübner (1851-1917) is sometimes labeled a German Impressionist. Yet his facture, his manner of handling paint and brush, never went so far as to dissolve physical forms into purely optical effects, the way it does in Impressionism. Rather, Trübner\u2019s attention to the atmospheric variability of nature came out of the tradition of Munich plein-air painting: Trübner began to study art in 1869 at the Akademie der schönen Künste in Munich, which at the time was the undisputed art capital of Germany. Outside of the academy, he also quickly became involved with the circle of artists around Wilhelm Leibl, a group of painters with anti-academy leanings who were greatly influenced by the French Realist Gustave Courbet, and devoted to Courbet\u2019s brand of naturalism. The artists of the Leibl circle (which also included Hans Thoma, whose painting The Spring LACMA acquired in 2008) focused on portraits, still lifes, and landscape compositions. They also developed a notion of \"pure painting,\" in which color and formal qualities were their primary focus, outweighing the requirements of traditional subjects and conventional composition schemes.Trübner was primarily a figure painter. He created ambitious scenes from history and literature, but also genre compositions and portraits, notably an extraordinary series of life-size plein-air equestrian portraits. Arguably, however, it is in Trübner\u2019s landscape paintings, more modest in scale and subject, that his sense of experimentation and innovation is most consistently realized.Trübner turned to landscape painting in the early 1870s, joining his friend Carl Schuch in exploring various locations around Munich. One of his favorite sites became Lake Chiemsee, already in the nineteenth century a popular tourist destination in Upper Bavaria. Trübner first visited the Chiemsee in 1873, but over the years returned numerous times to paint a series of views on the lake\u2019s two main islands, Frauenchiemsee and Herrenchiemsee.The 1891 painting Frauenchiemsee is one of two that depict the same striking vista of the Benedictine convent on the island; its sturdy bell tower and white buildings are seen from a low vantage point across an expansive meadow. The convent was founded in the eighth century and rebuilt in the early eighteenth century. In the early nineteenth century it was secularized, but reinstated by King Ludwig I in 1836. Dedicated to girls\u2019 education, the convent buildings are still in use, looking very much like they do in Trübner\u2019s painting.However, Trübner\u2019s composition is not a picture postcard. Avoiding the conventions of the picturesque mode, it offers an original, painterly take on the scene. The picture\u2019s most striking features are the idiosyncratically dramatized perspective and the vigorously brushed foreground, behind which the motif itself, the historic site, seems almost incidental. Trübner\u2019s earlier tonal palette, so typical of the Leibl circle, now has given way to a brighter, more intense range of colors, and his technique has taken on a characteristic steady rhythm of short, straight strokes that generate the pictorial structure. The brilliant play of colors \u2013 blue against white against bright green and dark green \u2013 and the energetic but fluid gesture are his primary subject. A first glance at Frauenchiemsee may bring to mind the art of Vincent Van Gogh, particularly in respect to the almost abstract brushwork in the meadow\u2019s darker half, where vivid green paint is lushly applied wet-in-wet. The meaning of this darker zone is unclear: it might be read as the shadow of a cloud overhead or the effect of a wind gust flattening long grasses; or, very possibly, as a mainly formal device intended to heighten the visual and expressive force of the picture \u2013 something Van Gogh would have understood. However, although Trübner had been in Paris in 1879 and 1889 for the Universal Expositions (even participating in the 1889 Exposition and garnering an honorable mention), there is no indication that he was even aware of the Dutch artist. At the time, Van Gogh\u2019s work was still very rarely shown and virtually unknown even in Paris. Much more so in Germany, where a first exhibition of Van Gogh\u2019s paintings, at the Galerie Paul Cassirer in Berlin, was a revelation in 1902. Trübner, who in the course of his career, published several essays about contemporary art in general and his own painting in particular, did not deal with Van Gogh at length until an article in 1915. Tellingly, he there ranked Van Gogh as a genius of only the second order: an outstanding, highly gifted colorist, who, however, in Trübner\u2019s estimation, fell sadly short in the area of technical proficiency, lacking the skill to create a sense of form. Undoubtedly, this assessment reveals less about Van Gogh than about Trübner\u2019s own position as a painter in the early twentieth century: as a modern colorist who eschewed the strict descriptiveness of academic art; but also did not subscribe to impressionism\u2019s dissolution of form, or to expressionism\u2019s subjective distortion.Claudia Einecke, Associate Curator, European Painting & Sculpture (2011)",

      "curator notes" : "Jean-Jacques Henner's portrait of Madame Paul Duchesne-Fournet, the wife of a prominent politician of the French Third Republic, created a sensation in Paris. Its extravagant price of 10,000 francs\u2014a sum rarely fetched by any commissioned portrait\u2014contributed to the fame of the portrait. Upon its completion, many connoisseurs visited Henner's studio to see specifically the painting which the artist refused to exhibit publicly at the 1880 Salon, a decision that added without doubt to the aura that surrounded the work.Henner is better known today for his many versions of academic nudes in misty landscapes, a genre that he developed toward the end of the nineteenth century and that brought him international fame. Earlier in his career, he was however one of the most sought-after painters of religious subjects and of portraits. Among the portrait painters of his generation, Henner developed a distinctive style. Less voluptuous than Carolus- Duran's but more spirited than Léon Bonnat's, Henner's portraits were particularly appealing to a clientele eager to display in a dignified manner their newly acquired wealth and social rank.As in this portrait, Henner typically set the sitter against a plain background so as to enhance the subject's fine features. In this portrait, Madame Duchesne-Fournet's black outfit is thinly painted in a manner prefiguring Whistler,but the austere atmosphere of the composition also recalls the full-size portraits of van Dyck and Goya. Indeed, Henner, who had been academically trained, often introduced technical innovations in his paintings that make it impossible to define him with precision as a traditional or modernist artist.",

      "curator notes" : "Last year, LACMA acquired a large painting by Isaac Moillon, an artist better known for his work at the Aubusson Manufactory. Isaac was the brother of the better-known Louise Moillon, a painter of still-lifes established in Paris in the first half of the seventeenth century. Both were children of Nicolas Moillon, himself a \u2013 now forgotten \u2013 artist.Still-life was considered a minor genre in seventeenth century France. For that reason few painters devoted their talent to painting the material world. As a woman, and as a Calvinist, Louise Moillon was, socially-speaking, an outsider; the otherness of her condition may have as a result to helped to abolish some of the strictures that regulated artistic life. She enjoyed great success, her paintings being already perceived as an answer to the challenge posed to French artists by their Northern colleagues, the undisputed masters in the field. Moillon brings starkness to her composition that is entirely hers: here for instance, the simplicity of the subject matter is reinforced by a powerful play of light that evokes even the art of Caravaggio \u2013 an unlikely source of inspiration for an artist who never traveled. Moillon\u2019s compositions are not emblematic and do not contain hidden religious meanings yet their simplicity evoke a spiritual world that echoes some of the most austere religious movements of the seventeenth century whether the Jansenist movement (illustrated pointedly in the portraits of Philippe de Chanmpaigne), or Moillon\u2019s own Calvinism.Moillon\u2019s work enjoyed success not only in her lifetime: more recently, her stark pictures appealed to collectors of both Dutch pictures and modern art. Basket of Peaches, Quinces and Plums offers a wonderful complement to Georges de La Tour\u2019s The Magdalen with the Smoking Flame and would illustrate the diversity of French painting under Louis XIII.

This composition is of particular importance, being the painting Restout submitted to the French Academy as a morceau d'agrément, the first step toward full acceptance as a member of that organization. A gift of Lynda and Stewart Resnick as a celebration of the Resnick exhibition in the new exhibition pavilion, Venus Ordering Arms from Vulcan for Aeneas will be featured in the eighteenth century French gallery.

      "history" : "A member of the great family of Bolognese painters, and a brother of the famous Gaetano, Ubaldo Gandolfi is an artist of particular distinction. Trained in Bologna, in the academic tradition established by the Carracci more than a century before his birth, Ubaldo brought that tradition to its apotheosis at the eve of Neo-Classicism. Famous for the soft poetry of his large compositions (as can be seen in LACMA\u2019s Selene and Endymion, circa 1770), Ubaldo also explored the possibilities offered by the direct study of models. Toward the end of his life, Ubaldo painted several studies of aging subjects, both male and female, of which the painting offered by MaryLou Boone is a particular remarkable example. Fully reproduced in both black and white and colors in the most recent book on the artist (Donatella Biagi Maino, 1990), this Head of an Old Woman has been considered a masterpiece by the artist since its appearance on the international art market in 1987.Its acquisition by LACMA completes a remarkable group of works by the Gandolfis: a painting and several drawings by Gaetano, the large and already mentioned painting by Ubaldo, as well as drawings and a sculpture.

To hear her poem, Rooftops Under Snow, press the play button below or scroll down to read a transcript.Rooftops Under Snow Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, In the bleak midwinter, long ago.\u2014Christina Rossetti I. Bright as folded paper hatsUpturned sailboats made on Lazy summer days, the rooftopsSeem ready, but for the weight Of snow, to wing themselves Away. Tortured into sharpPlanes, white kites, rooftops cut The silent smoke-dense sky into A complex shape, sail throughLate afternoon when all is Still before the night shoulders Out the long, pale, winter day II. Somewhere not too far lies Forest, or at least a stand of trees Bare of leaves and laced with iceCold so fine it cracks the breath Of wind into a filigree. No angles Here, just the abstract designSnow makes where it outlines Burrows, stones and stream Crochets the needles of the pineInto a latticed rooftop against A darkening sky, etched with the Day\u2019s last diamonds of lightIII. Hushed town prepares for sleep Under rooftops iced into a graceful Geometry. The woodland muttersAnd creaks as new snow settles On branches before the nighttime Freeze. Lighted windows in a darkFaçade wink. A hundred years later Real town, imaginary trees, become A poet\u2019s reverie. Painted DanishRooftops wing their way through Time to mind, simple as paper Airplanes tossed into a winter sky © 2014 Karen Holden",

      "curator notes" : "Gustave Surand's St. George and the Monster plays out as a chilling confrontation between animals: a spirited horse, two muscular dogs, and a fantastic, menacing dragon. Their vividly portrayed reactions\u2014from slinking fear and sheer terror to cold confidence\u2014stand in contrast to the relatively passive human figures, who seem little more than embellishments. This is an unusual staging of the well-known religious legend of St. George, who killed a dragon terrorizing a royal city in Libya. In Christian theology that episode symbolizes the triumph of good over evil, and illustrations of it normally depict St. George delivering the coup-de-grace. Surand's shift from human to animal protagonists suggests a different interest. It reveals some of the tensions that came into play when making an ambitious relevant Salon painting in the late 1880s\u2014tensions between the expectations of academic art, natural science, and visual entertainment.Surand was a master of the academic style, delivering correct drawing, detail realism, and high finish in the service of lifelike illusionism. He was a brilliant and prolific painter of animals, and even his dragon, a figment of the imagination, looks and acts as believably and naturally as the real horse and dogs\u2014possessively guarding its prey and warily eyeing its opponents. Physically, the dragon is a hybrid of various animal species, with an eagle's beak, enormous lion paws, an iguana's wattle and pointy spinal ridge, and the mosaic-like scales of a snake.This characterization may have been inspired by old, pre-scientific beliefs that dragons were born from the mingled \"seed\" of decomposing dead animals; or else by ongoing debates over Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection, and over what fossil and dinosaur-bone finds revealed about extinct species. However, Surand's composition was no more intended as a scientific treatise than it was meant to be a religious painting. While its scale and size identified it as a serious work, and while it engaged a current topic, it also delivered the kind of spectacular enchantment viewers had come to expect from large-scale works of art. The picture not only introduced a fantastic yet plausible and up-to-date monster; it also offered an excitingly spiced-up version of the familiar story\u2014titillating with a dose of delectable nudity and gratuitous gore. In addition, Surand furnished the very real pleasures of a perfectly crafted painting: an elegant palette of pearly grays and earthy golds, and technical bravura that embraces flawless high finish in the figures as well as dynamic free brushwork in the rocks. The painting's visual sumptuousness heightens the frisson elicited by the sensational scene.St. George and the Monster adds an original twist to LACMA's presentation of the late nineteenth century, anchoring a group of other academic works by Rosa Bonheur, Auguste Glaize, and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. The spectacular aspects of Surand's talent\u2014the beauty of style and execution; the fantastic, quasi-scientific interpretation of the story; and, last but not least, the astonishing extravagant dragon\u2014captivate and enchant viewers today as they did in 1888.",

      "curator notes" : "Hidden in a private British collection for 160 years and unknown to Cortona scholars until recently, Saint Martina has never been exhibited or published before. Its subject, Saint Martina, was intimately familiar to the artist, and the young Roman martyr frequently appeared in his work. An architect as well as a painter, Pietro da Cortona designed the church dedicated to the saint in the Roman Forum, executed a famous altarpiece depicting her martyrdom for the Siena Cathedral, and created other compositions in which the saint appears, such as The Madonna and Child with Saint Martina (c. 1645), acquired in 1984 by the Kimbell Art Museum Fort Worth, Texas. Paintings by Cortona can also be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, but his work remains rare in American museums.Cortona was a prominent artist and architect of the Roman baroque period. A protégé of three popes\u2014Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014he was also the official painter for a number of the wealthiest families in 17th-century Rome. To this day, Cortona's fresco ceiling in the Grand Salon of the Palazzo Barberini (now the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica), painted in 1635, remains a major attraction in Rome. An illusionistic masterpiece, the ceiling is an allegory to the glory of the Barberini family that not only demonstrates Cortona's dexterity at organizing a complex composition but also displays his mastery of drawing and use of brilliant colors.Saint Martina was a Roman virgin believed to have been martyred in the year 226 or 228 for her unwavering commitment to her Christian faith. Cortona has portrayed her in this painting as the embodiment of health and beauty even though she is said to have suffered numerous tortures, including being hung on a hook, before she was ultimately beheaded. Here she is shown holding the hook as well as a palm frond, a traditional symbol of saintly martyrdom; her right arm rests on a fallen structure, a reference to the Roman idols she refused to worship.Saint Martina is one of the many generous gifts made by The Ahmanson Foundation to LACMA. The Foundation has continually supported the acquisitions of LACMA's Department of European Painting. LACMA Director Michael Govan said, \"The Ahmanson Foundation has been the most consistent and generous donor to the museum in its history. Over the years, it has been through its support that the museum has been able to add masterworks by such artists as Guido Reni, Georges de La Tour, and Jacques-Louis David.\"",

      "curator notes" : "Cima da Conegliano ranks among the most important painters of the Renaissance in Venice. A painter of religious subjects, notably of numerous representations of the Madonna and Child, Cima occupies a key position between the influential Bellini family and the world of Giorgione and Titian. Following the example of both Jacopo and Giovanni Bellini, Cima painted moving images of the Madonna and Child in compositions remarkable for their hieratic presence. Departing from the paintings of the Bellini and their workshop, which were based on Byzantine models, Cima's compositions are full of life and naturalism evidenced in the poetic landscapes he uses as backgrounds. A sublime example of the artist's production in the last decade of the 15th century, the painting shows the Mother watching carefully over the Child precariously balanced over her lap. In the background, a small hill town may be the painter's own hometown of Conegliano, and to the left are featured scenes from the life of Mary including the Flight into Egypt, and the Visitation.Works by Cima - a painter well represented in all major museums - are extremely rare to find. The rediscovery of this painting, hidden for many years in a private German collection was hailed as a major event in the art world.",

      "curator notes" : "Born in Muenster, Germany, Jan Boeckhorst settled in Antwerp around 1626. He trained with both Jacob Jordaens and Peter Paul Rubens, becoming eventually a close collaborator of the latter. This triptych is one of the artist's most famous works. It was painted as a memorial tribute to Mary Snyders (1588-1659), the sister of Frans Snyders, the famous still-life painter.The commission illustrates further the links that united the various members of the Rubens circle of which Snyders and Boeckhorst were illustrious members. Mary Snyders was a beguine or nun and the altarpiece was put above her tomb in the church of the Begijnhof where it remained until 1798, at which date the church was sold. The painting however remained the property of the religious community until 2007.The triptych illustrates the Annunciation on the left panel and two scenes from the Life of Christ: The Ascension on the right panel, and in the center one a grandiose Resurrection. The triptych shows the artist's mature style characterized by an awareness of van Dyck from whom the artist borrows a free brushwork and chromatic brilliance. The reverse of the wings are painted in gold-brown camaieu and show symbols of the four Evangelists, surrounded by decorative arabesques reminiscent of designs executed by contemporary silversmiths.This triptych joins the museum's collection of Flemish seventeenth century paintings and illustrates with eloquence the close relationship between Rubens, his pupils, and collaborators.",

      "curator notes" : "Isaac Moillon is a rediscovery of modern art history. Born in a large family of painters whose best-known member is, atypically, his sister, Louise Moillon, a remarkable painter of still life that, to this day, appeal to collectors of Northern paintings, Isaac achieved considerable fame in his lifetime. As the main designer of \"cartons\" or models for the Aubusson tapestry manufactory, he occupied a semi official position in the highly structured artistic life of seventeenth century France.As a painter, Moillon worked for the Church (in spite of his belonging to the Reformed Faith) \u2014 one of his main commissions being the decoration of the Hotel Dieu at Beaune \u2014 and for a small group of enlightened provincial aristocrats in the regions of Auvergne and Limousin, in central France. His only recorded decoration for a hotel in Paris, on the spot currently occupied by the Bibliotheque Nationale, did not survive.The reconstruction of his work began in the early 1980's (culminating in an exhibition and major catalogue in 2005) and has thus far yielded an original body of work whose existence challenges our established notion of classicism. While his paintings reveal subtle affinities with the works of some of his contemporaries, Laurent de la Hyre and Jacques Stella (artists represented in LACMA's collection) in particular, they are also striking for their originality and elegance. Particularly remarkable are the decorations done by Isaac Moillon in the early 1650's for various chateaus in the Auvergne. Sophonisbe Drinking Poison seems to belong to this group. The subject of Queen Sophonisba drinking poison rather than being paraded in the Roman triumph of her victor, Scipio Africanus, was much in favor in French literary circles at the time Moillon executed this painting. Plays by Jean Mairet (1634), Georges de Scudery and Pierre Corneille (1663) had made the theme popular with the public.What links this painting to the decorations Isaac Moillon executed \u2014 also in 1653 \u2014 for the Chateau of Saint Quintin sur Sioule is not only their similar style, but also their subject illustrating heroic women: Sophonisba, Porcia (committing suicide by eating coals), and Esther fainting before Ahasuerus. The painting's striking figures, clear colors, and elegant details such as the carpet or the huge \u2014 almost neoclassic urn, evoke a form of mannerism that seems anachronistic with the date of the painting, 1653. Indeed Moillon adopts here a narrative form that is as opposed as can be imagined from the solemn and severe classicism of Poussin at the same time. It is also quite different from Moillon's own previous style at Beaune in the mid 1640\u0092s. There, Moillon's sturdier figures belong more fully to the prevalent French classical canon. The stylistic shift remains unexplained and seems to have been dictated more by the subject than by any other reason.This very rare painting adds to the museum's important collection of seventeenth century French painting and adds a fresh, unexpected \u2014 indeed unique \u2014 note to it. There are no other paintings by the artist in any other American museum.",

      "curator notes" : "Painter Baron François-Pascal-Simon Gerard used his connection as Jacques-Louis David's understudy to evade conscription in 1793 and avoid proclaiming political allegiances. During a tumultuous period in France, he spent his career aligning himself with the parties in power, serving as the official portrait painter for Napoleon and then working for the reinstated Bourbon monarchs. Here, Gerard sketched a microcosmic drama depicting the people\u2019s triumph on the 10th of August, a key event in the French Revolution: the people stand powerful, armed with their pointed fingers and aggressive postures, while the king and queen lurk helplessly behind bars. The composition of the work adds to this drama by relegating the royal duo to the background. In a similar spirit, the works of the playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (1732-1799), which gave rise to the fictional character of Figaro, openly criticized aristocratic authority in the years before the Revolution. In works by Beaumarchais, Figaro uses his cunning to quietly manipulate the Count Almaviva, taking a more covert approach than Gerard\u2019s bourgeoisie, who employ vehement disapproval and violence to overthrow Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.",

      "curator notes" : "Introduction: Similar to the way French playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (1732-1799) used his plays featuring the fictional character of Figaro to champion lower-class morality, painter Jacques-Louis David employed classical allegories to illustrate the Republican virtues he saw emerging in France during the Revolution. David became famous for these politically charged history paintings, but he turned to portraiture after the Terror in 1794. This particular work is the last David painted before he fled to Brussels in 1815. The subject of this painting, Jean-Pierre Delahaye, was a man of persistence: he continued his law practice during the years of the Revolution by repeatedly completing the regime\u2019s frequently changing requirements. David focused on illuminating Delahaye\u2019s trustworthy expression, honoring their close friendship. In the year of Delahaye\u2019s death in 1819, an obituary revered him as \u201cthe most upright and distinguished member of the Bar,\u201d validating David\u2019s representation of his strong moral character. Curator\u2019s Note: The year 1815 marks a turning point in Jacques-Louis David's life and career. Born in Paris, but trained in Rome, David had been the most visible artist in France since the return to his country in 1780. The new style he promoted in compositions remarkable for their clarity and splendid craftsmanship was revolutionary in many ways: David offered an alternative to the late Rococo style of his erstwhile teacher, François Boucher, and his paintings conveyed a moral tone and implied message of support for new political ideals that resonated with a large segment of the public. David himself joined the ranks of the revolutionaries, served in the government and put his talent to the service of the new regime. At the end of the French Revolution, David supported the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, eventually rallying to Napoleon and becoming his favorite and official artist.On March 20, 1815 Napoleon, who had been held prisoner on the island of Elba, escaped and arrived in Paris after a sweeping march through France. The following period, known as the 100 days, saw a rapid - but short-lived, re-establishment of Napoleon's power. Napoleon did not remain oblivious to the fate of his favorite artist. Reinstated in his position as official painter only five days after Napoleon's arrival in Paris, David signed an oath of fidelity to Napoleon, which sealed his political fate when Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo on June 15, 1815, triggered the former Emperor's abdication. Fearing the consequences of his unconditional dedication to Napoleon, David hastily decamped for Switzerland. Back in Paris in September 1815, the political situation grew uncomfortable for him. In January 1816, Louis XVIII back in power for the second time promulgated an edict condemning the exile of those who, like David, had pledged allegiance to Napoleon. At the end of January 1816, David left for Brussels, where he died in 1825.It was against this political background that David found time to execute the portrait of Jean-Pierre Delahaye, dated and signed 1815 - the last portrait David executed in France. Delahaye was a lawyer who had helped David with the management of his affairs since 1812. At the time of his exile, David appointed him as his proxy in Paris. Delahaye, for instance, handled the sale of David's early masterpieces, The Sabine Women and Leonidas at the Thermopylae, to Louis XVIII, who wished to acquire them for the Louvre but refused to deal directly with the painter. The exact circumstances of the portrait are unknown. One can imagine that the ties that linked the two men were sufficient to prompt David to execute his friend's portrait, perhaps as payment for services rendered. The portrait, never previously exhibited, remained in the Delahaye family.The portrait itself is remarkable in representing a personable subject with a great dignity worthy of Roman Republican portraits, the kind David would have studied and admired while a student in Rome. The subject is painted with great economy; the sitter's dark jacket and grey-blue vest set off his elaborate white cravat and enhance the subject's engaging expression.This remarkable portrait, a major rediscovery and addition to the artist's oeuvre completes an important group of paintings of the Revolutionary and Empire periods, already in the museum's collection.",

      "curator notes" : "Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin's work gained public attention just as a reaction to the elaborate style of rococo art was setting in. He was admitted to the French Royal Academy as a still-life painter in 1728, a rare honor, as still life was then considered far less valid than paintings of historical, mythological, or courtly subjects. Even though his work reflected the ordinary images, decorum, and morality of the bourgeois life from which he came, Chardin's talent was recognized in artistic and aristocratic circles.Chardin began to paint genre subjects in the late 1730s, evoking through his observation of everyday life a contemplative atmosphere that in France had largely remained the domain of religious painting. In some ways his compositions heralded the values of the art of the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on rational content, naturalistic imagery, and qualities of truth and directness in subject matter.Soap Bubbles is carefully composed in the simplest of geometries, with the window forming a rectangular space to frame the pyramidal grouping of the youth and the boy transfixed by the spherical bubble; these shapes are reinforced by the masonry, angles of the youth's arms, and the pair of heads. Chardin renders surfaces carefully but without distracting detail. A sense of timeless contemplation transforms the ephemeral pastime of the pair into a compelling allegory about the transitory nature of life. This is far from being a scene of carefree, youthful abandon.",
